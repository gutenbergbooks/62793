<div><h1>BE SURE THAT YOU SEE ARIGHT!</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The preservation of the useful and beautiful animal and
bird-life of the country depends largely upon creating in
the young an interest in the life of the woods and fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the child mind is fed with stories that are false to
nature, the children will go to the haunts of the animal
only to meet disappointment. The result will be disbelief,
and the death of interest. The men who misinterpret
nature and replace fact with fiction, undo the work of those
who in the love of nature interpret it aright.</p>

<div><h1>TO THE GROWN-UP—LEND A HAND!</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The training of the eye to correct seeing is one of the
great advantages of bird study to the average child,
quite aside from the value of the information gained, for
this accurate gauge of the eye will always be a benefit in
whatever calling may be followed, adding alike to the
pleasure and profit of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In every town or country village there is some one who
takes more than passing interest in the life outdoors,
who has a keener eye and more responsive ear than his
neighbour, coupled with a heart that has a bit of Eden still
lodged in it, so that it keeps tender and yearning toward
the simple, direct affections of life, as expressed in childhood
and the lives of the timid wild brotherhood, whether
of foot or wing. Are you one of these? If so, do you
not realize that from your very make-up you draw more
freely from nature’s bounty than do your neighbours,
and are you not bound to share your pleasure with them?
Not alone because it is pleasure, but that through the
knowledge that comes with all real joy, the wild bird or
beast may be more fully understood, and therefore protected.
All the more is this just and right, because we
ourselves in our advancement are the main cause of
their need of this protection, for as man increases, possesses,
builds, and overflows the earth, so do these “kindred
of the wild” dwindle and silently disappear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lesser beasts keep more aloof than do the birds.
These still gather freely in our gardens, fields, and woods
if we permit, and if we offer food and shelter, many quickly
become responsive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will not you who enjoy this friendship share it with
others to whom it is perhaps entirely unknown and unguessed,
and to whom even the names of birds, beyond a
familiar few such as Hawk, Owl, Robin, and Sparrow,
are an unknown language?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bird lectures are many, but there are those who
cannot reach them. The bird protective societies are
tireless, but the ground must be prepared for the message
they send forth, and there is no better way for doing this
than by the influence of a personality working quietly
and unconsciously that infects all with whom it comes in
contact with its wholesome enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you are a parent or teacher, well and good; your
field is ready at hand. If not, you may still become the
equivalent of both in your community even though
you lack some of Gray Lady’s attributes and resources.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you have the right faculty and books at hand, you
do not need my aid; but if the work of holding youth is as
yet an untried experiment, tuck this little volume into
the corner of your school desk, the magazine rack, or your
work-basket at home, for rainy days or the between times
when lack of occupation breeds mischief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much that is told in the following pages was thought
out, in another form, especially for the use of teachers of
the rural schools of Connecticut, but it is applicable to
the needs of children in any of the eastern states, and
whether the knowledge passes from the school to the home
or the home to the school, the process is the same. The
walk between the rural school and home along bushy lanes
and tree-bordered highways, however, is an important
link in the chain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For children so placed the birds and every possible
motive for wanting to know them lie at hand, but for this
very reason the public library wherein the books to answer
questions may be found is perhaps many miles away and
it is not possible for every school or home to own the
necessary bird books or charts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must not for a moment be thought that any attempt
is made to say anything new or add to the information
given in the many excellent and complete
books now in circulation, but merely to condense in a
simple form things that have been said. Not detailed
descriptions and tabulated facts—for these repel the
beginner and seem but the spelling-book or multiplication
table in a new form—but to record the doings of some
children who were eager to know; together with a few hints
upon the migrations, winter feeding, and protection of
some of our common birds, and the stories of their lives,
that may lead both teacher and pupil to more detailed
study when opportunity offers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When a strange child comes to school, the first desire of
his mates is to know his name and nationality, from
whence he came, where he lives, whether he is merely a
visitor or to be a permanent resident in the community.
All this must be weighed and well considered before the
newcomer is admitted to the friendship of his mates, and
it may be that there will be some prejudices against him
that the teacher must either remove by explanation or
overcome by reason and example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is very much the same with a bird. After being
attracted to him and fixing upon his name as an individual
his identity should be still further established by finding
to what family he belongs and then later on placing this
family in one of the great orders of the bird world. These
two last should not be dwelt upon, however, until the identity
as an individual is established, but in the end it will
help to keep the name in the memory to know the kinship
of families as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are many little points of comparison, of scientific
but not general value that cannot be seen unless the dead
bird is held in the hand, and then only a wise man, perhaps,
would be able to point them out. It is with the
living bird, on the wing or in its nest in the bushes, that
we are concerned; not with the poor little dead thing with
its limp neck and bloody, rumpled feathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We should not learn enough from such a bird to in any
way make up for taking its life; it would be both wasteful
and against the law. So we must be content to believe
what the Wise Men say, who must study the dead birds in
order to preserve the scientific knowledge of their structure
and keep them in public museums, that they may teach the
world how wonderful a thing bird-life is, and show us that
we must do all we can to protect it. For the Wise Men
know very well that—</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.2em;font-size:2em;font-weight:bold;'>GRAY LADY AND THE BIRDS</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='1' id='Page_1'></span><h1 class='nobreak'>I<br/> <span class='sub-head'>GRAY LADY APPEARS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Sarah Barnes hurried up the hill road so fast that by
the time she reached the short bit of lane that turned in at
her own gate she was quite out of breath, and oh, so
warm! Fanning vigorously with her sun-hat did not help
her much, for its wide rim had a rent in it, made by Jack,
the family puppy, so that when she reached the steps of
the porch, she sank down in a heap, only having breath
enough to exclaim, “Oh, grandma, what <span class='it'>do</span> you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old lady Barnes with a sigh dropped the checked shirt
that she was patching into the big work-basket that
rested on the bench beside her. This basket was already
overflowing with other garments for both boys and girls,
that needed everything in the way of repair from a button
to a knee patch, or even to a whole sleeve, for with a slim
purse and six children to keep covered neither Grandma
Barnes’ work-basket nor her fingers knew many empty
moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking off her spectacles and rubbing her eyes, as if to
see the news as well as to hear it, she said: “Don’t tell
me Tommy has got hurt in that reaping-machine, down at
Weatherby’s. I told your pa he was too young to handle
such a job!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
“No, Tommy’s all right—they were gathering in the
last stack as I came by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lammy <span class='it'>hasn’t</span> gone in swimming again down to the
crick with the Connor boys?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nope, he’s stopped behind at the Centre to tend store
for Mr. Sims, ’cause his horse got loose in Deacon Mason’s
orchard and ate himself into the colic!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Billy hasn’t fell off the fish-market roof, has he?
Your pa took him there this mornin’ to help hand up
shingles, though ’twas against my wishes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, grandma, Billy’s all right, too,” said Sarah, who
had recovered her breath by this time and was beginning
to laugh. “What makes you always think worry? Pa is
all right, and Mary and Ruth are helping the minister’s
wife get the hall ready for the cake sale, and I’m here, so
you see there’s nothing the matter with <span class='it'>us</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think worry!” exclaimed grandma, now settling her
glasses again and preparing to hear the news comfortably
so long as neither her son nor his children, to whom she
was both grandmother and mother, were in danger, “wait
until your only son’s wife dies and leaves you to keep track
of six children, with as mixed tempers and complexions as
ducks, chickens, and turkeys all in one brood, and I guess
you’ll think worry too. But why don’t you fetch out your
news?—Not but what you are all good and promising
enough in your way,” she added hastily, lest she should be
found belittling her own flesh and blood, which she considered
next to breaking the whole ten commandments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, granny,” began Sarah, bringing out her words
slowly, and satisfied that the old lady’s expectations were
sufficiently raised and that she would have an attentive
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
listener, “the General Wentworth place is open and they’re
putting new fences all around the back of it, and a lovely
Gray Lady and a little girl with golden hair have come to
live there. They have been there since spring too, and I
didn’t know it. The girl is as old as me, but she’s smaller,
for she isn’t strong and sits in a wheel-chair, and they’ve
asked me to come in again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Off came the glasses, and the old hands that folded them
away in their case trembled with excitement. “The
General Wentworth place open after all these years, since
his only daughter Elizabeth married her cousin John,
whom we all expected to die a bachelor, and then he fell
into poor health! You don’t remember him, Sarah
Barnes, ’cause you wasn’t born, but he was a mighty
strange fellow, handsome and likely; he wouldn’t be a
soldier as his uncle wished, but he was great for readin’
books, and he used to wander all over the country here
watching birds and things and drawin’ pictures of them.
I heard John died a couple of years ago away in foreign
parts,—it can’t be Elizabeth that’s come back,—she
wouldn’t be a gray-haired old woman, as you say. I knew
her when she was a girl. She was full of life and rode a
pony everywhere; her father used to bring her over
to our mill, and many a ginger cooky of my baking has
she ate. No, it can’t be little Miss Elizabeth,—it’s more
likely some one that has hired or bought the place and
goin’ to upset and change it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t say the lady was old, grandma; she has lots of
soft, silvery, wavy hair with big gray eyes to match, and
such a pretty colour in her cheeks, and her dress was soft
and fluffy too and the colour as if purple and white violets
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
and silver popple leaves were all mixed together,” said
Sarah, moving her hands before her, a little way she had
when talking, as if in describing what she had seen she
was touching the real object, for Sarah, though only a little
girl from a bare hillside farm and taught at the school below
at Foxes Corners, had a keen eye for colour and loved
beautiful things, so that ugliness or unkindness of any
sort really hurt her if she could have explained her feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Gray Lady’s first name is Elizabeth, though, and
she knows you and your molasses cakes,” continued Sarah,
after a moment’s pause, “for she said, ‘When you go home
say to your grandmother that Elizabeth who rode the black
pony sends her love, and that she will go to see her soon,
and that she hopes that she will give the little Elizabeth
some of the cookies of which she has often heard.’ Elizabeth
is the little girl, but I’m going to call her Goldilocks,
because the name matches her hair and she looks as if she
was meant to—</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“ ‘Sit on a cushion and sew a fine seam</p>
<p class='line0'>And feast upon strawberries, sugar, and cream.’ ”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Elizabeth Wentworth and her daughter back here
and I never knew it!” cried Grandma Barnes, rising
as if to take immediate action. “Your Aunt Jane might
well say, as she did on her last visit, that this hill farm is
as far out o’ the world as livin’ in a lighthouse that had no
stairs or boat to it, and the only way to get anywhere was
to take a dive and swim. But see here, Sarah Barnes,
how did you come to meet the General’s folks? It’s near a
mile from the road up from the Centre to their front gate;
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
mebbe you ran across them in the village, and if so, how
came you to speak?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sarah opened her lips to answer and then stammered
and grew red under her grandmother’s keen gaze. “I
didn’t pass their gate and I didn’t meet them in the village.
I was—I was just taking a bunch of field flowers, that I
got along the road, up to the cemetery to mother, and
then when I go there, I usually take some to the General’s
mound too, ’cause nobody took anything, except a little
flag Memorial Day, and it’s usually all faded by now.
This year, though, the lot was planted with flowers, and I
was wondering why. I was sittin’ there watching a
gray squirrel that lives in one of the old cannons that
stand at the plot corners. You see the squirrel knows
me because I’ve taken him nuts two winters whenever
we’ve gone to Pine Hill coasting, and he comes up real
close. To-day when he came up, I only had some cracker
crumbs in my pocket, but he acted real pleased to see me,
and I was so busy talking to him that I didn’t hear anybody
coming up until somebody said, ‘Who is this little
girl that brings flowers to an old soldier’s grave, and has
a squirrel for a friend?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A nice way of wasting your time, I must say, of a week-day
afternoon, and so much to be done at home,” broke
in Mrs. Barnes, rather crossly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Sarah, not minding the interruption, continued:
“Then I jumped up, and there was Gray Lady and Goldilocks
sitting in a nice big straw chair, like those on Judge
Jones’ porch, only it had wheels and a handle behind like
a baby wagon, and a fattish woman with a pleasant face
was pushing it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
“Well, what happened next?” asked grandma. “I
wonder she didn’t tell you not to trespass and feed animals
in a cemetery!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, she liked it, and we got acquainted right away.
She asked me what put it in my head to bring the flowers,
and told her that it was because nobody else did and
that I loved the General because my mother told me that
though he lived through a lot of battles, he got
the wound that made him die long after, in trying to get
back a little black child that had been sold away from its
mother, for it’s an awful thing to take children away from
their mothers, and only God should do it, and I know He
must be always sorry when He has to. And I said I knew
how it hurt because He took my mother away from me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goldilocks said she wished that she had a tame squirrel
down in her garden, and I said there were plenty of squirrels
there, and she could begin to tame ’em as soon as food
gets scarce. Then she asked how I knew, and then it all
came out that Dave and Tommy Todd, Mary, and I often
take a cross-cut through the General’s orchard, when we
go over to Aunt Jane’s. Then they asked me to walk
down home with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a new high fence all round the orchard,
with a gate by the old house in the corner that has the
big stone chimney, where the Swallows live, so we can’t
cut across any more, and before I thought, I said so; but
Gray Lady said, ‘I think, Sarah, it will be quite as pleasant
for you to come in at the front gate, and go out at the
back, as to crawl through a hole in the brush like a fox
or a woodchuck,’ and I guess it will, for she doesn’t want
us to stop coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
“Then I asked her if the house had lovely pictures in
it and birds with real eyes sitting on perches, and more
books than the Sunday-school library, and she laughed
and asked who told me that, and I said it was Jake
Gorham that went up there to set new glass in the roof
light after the hail-storm last summer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sarah Barnes! such gall as to make free and talk to
General Wentworth’s daughter like that! I just wonder
what she thinks of you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She didn’t tell me, grandma; but, oh, what do you
suppose, she said that if I came down some afternoon,
she’d show me all the pictures and then I could tell Goldilocks
how to begin to make friends with the squirrels,
and that she would show me their tree with a lunch-counter
on it for birds, where there is something for every kind to
eat. Do you suppose she will ask me for this Saturday,
grandma, and may I wear my pink lawn, if it stays warm?
My Sunday dress for fall shows where the hem was let
down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She may and then again mayhap ’twill be the last
you’ll ever hear of it. Come to think of it, in those days
my ginger cookies were mixed with butter instead of lard,
and they had currants in them. I guess I’ll risk it to
make a batch to-morrow, lest Mrs. John should come up—that
is if I finish all this mending, for there is only one
more Saturday and Labor Day, and then school opens, and
all you girls and boys will be making excuses for shirking
your chores. Five o’clock already! Sarah Barnes, do
you go straight out and feed the chickens and then rinse
those milk-pans,—that comes first before all the fine talk
of seein’ pictures and making pies and cakes for birds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
Sarah went slowly toward the barnyard and fed the
greedy fowls in an absent-minded sort of way, all the
while looking across the field where the birds were beginning
to gather in flocks, wishing she knew them all
by name and thinking of Gray Lady and Goldilocks.
Would they remember the invitation or would she never
perhaps see them again? School would soon begin, and
that meant no spare time until after four, and it is so often
rainy on Saturday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rain did not wait for Saturday this time, for a heavy
drizzle set in that night, and Sarah went to sleep wondering
exactly what a bird lunch-counter was and what became
of it when it rained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then school began, and her new friend made no sign,
and Sarah began to wonder if her meeting with Gray
Lady had been one of the dreams she so often had when
she sat on the orchard fence in June watching the
bobolinks fly over the clover and waiting for things to
happen.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span><h1>II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A RAINY DAY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first Friday of the fall term and there were
only fifteen scholars at the weather-beaten shingled schoolhouse
at Foxes Corners. The usual number in winter
was twenty-five, but some of the older pupils did not
return until late in October, for these boys and girls helped
their fathers and mothers either about the farm work or
in the house, and as this school district was located in
pretty rolling hill country, with woods and a river close by,
city people came to board at the farm-houses and often
did not go away until they had seen the leaves redden and
fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Wilde, the teacher, was very glad to begin with
only fifteen scholars. She was not very strong; the
children were always restless during the first month after
their vacation. Then, too, it is more difficult for a teacher
to interest scholars that range from five to fifteen than
where she has children all of an age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Wilde was very patient, for she loved outdoors and
liberty herself, and she knew just how hard it was in these
first shut-in days for the children to look out the open
windows and see the broad fields stretching out to the
woods, and hear the water rushing over the dam at Hull’s
Mill, and then take any interest in bounding the Philippine
Islands and remembering why they are of special
value to the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
Tommy Todd was what is usually called the “bad
boy” of the school. He was thirteen, keen-witted and
restless. He learned his lessons quickly, and then when
Miss Wilde was hearing the little ones drone out their
“twice one is two,” “twice two is four,” he often sat idle
in his seat devising mischief that he sometimes put in
motion before school was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there were some days when it seemed as if Tommy
would leave his desk and fly out of the window in spite of
himself. Poor Miss Wilde had been obliged to make
him change desks twice already. From his first place he
could look at a pasture, where a family of woodchucks
had their burrows, and he had caused several stampedes,
not only among the boys, but girls also, by calling out:
“Hi! there goes a buster! I bet its hide’s worth more’n
a quarter! Now Jones’ yaller dog is after him! Hi!
there! good work! he’s headin’ of it off! Gee, Hog’s
reared and give him a bite! There they go round the
hill! If the hole back t’other side I stuffed Saturday’s
got loosed out, I bet on the hog!” (Ground-hog being
the familiar name for the woodchuck in this region.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Order being restored, Tommy was moved to the east
side of the room. Here the view was downhill over the
lowlands, ending at a great corn-field that belonged to
Tommy’s grandfather. The corn was yellow in the ear,
but still standing. <a id='crow1'></a>A flock of crows that had a roost in
the swampy millwoods knew all about this corn-field and
considered it as their own property, for had they not superintended
its planting, helped thin out the seed lest it
should grow too thick, and croaked and quavered directions
to old man Todd and his horses every time they ploughed
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
and hoed? Now, guided by a careful old leader who sat
on a dead sycamore top and gave warning (for all crow
flocks have such a chief), they were beginning to attack
the ripened ears, the scarecrows placed at intervals
that had been of some use in the early season having
now lost the little influence they possessed and fallen into
limp heaps, like unfortunate tramps asleep by the wayside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So every time the crows came over, Tommy would
stretch up in his seat and finally slip out of it entirely and,
hanging half out of the window, shake his fist at them,
all the time uttering dire threats of what he would do if
he only had his father’s shot-gun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For these reasons, Friday morning saw him seated in the
middle of the room with the older girls and sharing the
double desk with Sarah Barnes. Now Sarah thought that
Tommy was the cleverest boy she had ever seen, and
Sarah had visited in Centre Village in Hattertown, and
Bridgeton, been twice to the Oldtown County Fair, and
would have gone to New York once with her Aunt Jane if
measles had not prevented; so that her friends thought,
for thirteen, she was quite a travelled lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy also considered her favourably and had been
heard to say that she was not bad for a girl; yet, to be put
in the middle seats with the girls he considered an insult
to his years, and he was sulky and brooded mischief all
the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reality Tommy was not a bad boy in any way.
What he wanted was plenty of occupation for his mind
and body to work at. Miss Wilde knew this and tried to
give him as many little things to do as possible. It was
Tommy who had charge of the new cage rat-trap of shiny
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
copper wire, in which it was hoped the field rats might be
caught, that, as soon as cool weather came, gnawed their
way in through the loose floor boards and sometimes
destroyed the books, and, as Sarah Barnes declared (whose
duty it was to keep the wells filled), drank the ink.
Tommy also kept the water-pail full and tended the big
wood-stove in winter; but none of these tasks seemed to
touch the restless spot and he could think out more puzzling
questions in a day than the whole school board could have
answered in a week, and then, as Sarah Barnes once said,
“Tommy Todd’s questions never seem to stay answered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Wilde had taught, at first, in the school of a large
town where there were plenty of pictures and maps on the
walls, and charts of different kinds and reference books
for the children to use, and where people who loved
children would often drop in and tell them about birds
and flowers or their journeys to interesting places. She
had taken the country school because the doctor thought
it would be better for her health, and oh, how she wished
that she could have brought some of the pictures and books
with her, or that some of the summer boarders who stayed
until almost winter would come in and talk to her pupils.
She told the children stories or read to them on Friday
afternoons. She also knew that there were some travelling
libraries of books that she might borrow that the
children could have themselves, but reading is a habit;
the children needed to be interested first. So it came
about that, when the second year of her school life on the
hillside began, Miss Wilde felt rather discouraged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this particular rainy Friday she was feeling worried
about her mother, who boarded at the Centre Village
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
and with whom she spent every week-end, going down with
the mail-carrier on his return trip Friday evening and
usually walking back on Sunday afternoon if no one
chanced to be driving that way. Mrs. Wilde had been ill
the Sunday before and Miss Wilde had not heard a word
all the week. Everything had gone awry that morning,
and when the last child had filed out for the dinner-hour
and gone splish-splashing up the muddy road, before
straightening out the room as usual, Miss Wilde sat down
at the desk, her head in her hands, and two big tears splashed
down on the inky blotting-paper before her. Presently she
wiped her eyes, opened all the windows that the rain did
not enter, took her box of luncheon from her desk, and
walked slowly down the side aisle to the little porch,
which also acted as the cloak-room, the place where she
usually ate her luncheon when it was too cool or wet to go
outdoors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she passed Tommy Todd’s desk she thought she heard
a noise, and glanced sideways, half expecting to see him
crouching under it, bent upon some prank. No one was
there, and still there was a scratching sound in that
vicinity. Opening the desk lid, Miss Wilde gave a scream,
for inside was the new trap and inside the trap two wicked-looking
old rats whose whiskers had evidently grown gray
with experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what he would have done with them if I
had not found him out?” she said to herself, as she lifted
the cage, by hooking the crook of her umbrella into the
handle on the top, and carrying it with the greatest care,
put it into the empty wood-box in the porch. Then she
seated herself on the bench by the outer door and unstrapped
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
her box. But it evidently was not intended that
the poor teacher should lunch that day, for suddenly the door
flew open and the weather-beaten face of Joel Hanks, the
carrier who had the forenoon mail-route, peered anxiously
in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You here, Miss Wilde?” he called anxiously. “I’m
glad yer hain’t gone up to the house for your nooning, cause
I clean fergot when I come by up, but yer Ma’s feelin’
extra poorly and uneasy, and she thought mebbe you
could come back along with me instead of waiting till
night. I’m goin’ to eat over to Todd’s and I can stop
back for you close to one if you can arrange to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I wish I had known it before the children went to
dinner,” she cried, clasping her hands together nervously
and dropping the box, out of which her lunch rolled to the
floor, amid the damp that had been made by wet coats,
overshoes, and dripping umbrellas. “As it is, when the
children come back, I cannot send them right home again,
for some have a long walk. If it wasn’t for Tommy
Todd, I could leave Sarah Barnes for monitor; but there
are those rats, and the school board does not like me to
shorten hours so soon after vacation. It’s too late for me
to go over for Mrs. Bradford, or I know that she would
help me by coming as she did several times last spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry I couldn’t stop this morning, but I come by the
lower road. Wall, mebbe you’ll think out some way and
I’ll stop back a bit a’ter one,” Joel said cheerfully, going
back to his covered cart and chirping to his wise old horse,
who, though he was gaunt and had only one good eye,
knew every letter-box on the route and solemnly zig-zagged
across the road from one to the other on his way up
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
to Foxes Corners, but as surely passed them by without
notice on the return trip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Wilde had barely swept away the scattered lunch
through the open door when again she heard wheels,
and looking up saw that which made her stand stock-still
in surprise, broom in hand,—a trim, glass-windowed depot
wagon, such as she had seldom seen out of Bridgeton,
drawn by a handsome pair of gray horses, whose long,
flowing tails were neatly braided and fastened up from
the mud with leather bands, instead of being cruelly
docked short as sometimes happens. The driver, a
pleasant-looking, rosy-cheeked man, was well protected
by coat and boot of rubber; but before Miss Wilde
could more than glance at the outfit the door opened and
a lady stepped lightly out, reaching the school porch
so quickly that she had no need of an umbrella.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spying Miss Wilde, she said in a voice clear as a bell,
and yet so well modulated and sweet that no one who
heard her speak ever forgot its sound—“Are you the
teacher here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosamond Wilde,” replied the astonished girl, hastily
hanging up the broom, unconsciously leading the way
into the stuffy schoolroom and placing the best chair by
the side of her desk, as she did when the minister, Dr.
Gibbs, from Centre Village, who was president of the
school board, came to hold a spelling-match.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said the silvery voice, as its owner took
the proffered seat, turning so that she could look out of
the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
“I have heard from Dr. Gibbs that you sometimes use
part of Friday afternoon for telling the children stories,
or reading something that may amuse as well as teach
them, and I thought that perhaps, as the board does not
object, you might sometimes be willing to have me come
in and talk to them. I am very fond of children, and
have one little girl of my own, so that I know very well
what they enjoy. I’ve travelled for several years, and
I have a great many interesting pictures I could show
them. Then, too, I have always loved birds and flowers,
and with my father I used to tramp about and learned
to know all those of this neighbourhood. I well remember
that when I was a child and studied at home, rainy Friday
afternoons were always pleasant, because mother, my
cousins, and I had fancy-work or some other sewing
and stories; so I thought to-day perhaps would be a good
time for a beginning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the sky had opened and an angel come directly to
her aid, Miss Wilde could not have been more overcome.
She pulled herself together and began to frame a polite
answer, when looking at the guest, who had thrown off
her light raincoat, she caught the sympathetic glance that
shot from a lovely pair of gray eyes with black lashes, and
saw that the fluffy gray hair belonged to a really young
woman, but a little older than herself. Forgetting that
a teacher is supposed never to lose control of herself,
before she realized that she had said a word she had told
this friend in need about her school, Tommy Todd, her
mother’s sickness, and all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In less time than it takes to tell of it, the coachman
had been told to go down to the blacksmith’s shop and
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
wait under cover until three o’clock, and Miss Wilde was
helped to make her preparation for leaving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the children came trooping back, they found the
door between cloak-room and schoolroom closed, and teacher
waiting for them in the outer room with very rosy cheeks
and a happier expression than her face usually wore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy Todd looked relieved, for, he reasoned, if
teacher knew there were two rats in his desk, she would
not have looked pleased. In a few words Miss Wilde
explained the happenings, cautioned them to be very good,
and saying, “Right, left, right, left,” was about to open
the door for the children to march in, when Sarah Barnes
asked, “Teacher, what is her name, so we can call her by
it?” Then teacher realized that she didn’t know. But
as the door opened Sarah said, in a very loud whisper,
as whispers are apt to sound louder than the natural voice,
“Why, it’s my Gray Lady!” and so in truth it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teacher watched them until they took their seats, and
then gently closed the door behind her. For a moment
no one spoke. Tommy Todd peeped cautiously into his
desk to be sure the rats were safe, and found to his dismay
that they were gone. Inwardly he hoped they wouldn’t
get loose, for Gray Lady didn’t look as if she would like
rats, which showed that after only one glance he wished to
please her, while at the same time the name by which they
first knew her became fixed in the mind of every child.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span><h1>III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>GRAY LADY AT SCHOOL</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The silence inside the school continued a full minute,
that seemed like an hour, and the dripping of the rain
from the gutter was so plain that Sarah found herself
counting the drops—“One—two—three—four—splash!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifteen pairs of eyes were fastened upon the newcomer,
and, as she caught the various questions in them, the
colour in her cheeks deepened. Suddenly she recognized
her little friend whom she had met on the hillside the
week before. “Sarah Barnes,” said Gray Lady, “will
you not tell me the names of your schoolmates and introduce
me to them? It is always so much more pleasant
when we are looking at people, places, or things to know
what they are called.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Sarah, delighted at being remembered when
she had begun to be quite sure that all her hopes
were in vain, guided by an inborn instinct of politeness
that told her it would not be civil to stand at her desk
and call out the various names, marched solemnly up
to the teacher’s desk and, beginning in the front row
with her own little sister Mary, repeated the fifteen
names in full, with the greatest care and distinctness,
and each child, not knowing what else to do, bobbed up
and answered, “Present,” the same as if teacher had been
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
calling the roll. When Sarah had finished, she was quite
out of breath, for some of the names were very long;
the last, that of the one little Slav in the school, Zella
Francesca Mowralski, being also hard to pronounce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Gray Lady; “I think that I can remember
the first names at least. But now that you have
presented your friends to me, won’t you kindly present
me to them? You know who I am and where I live, do
you not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I do!” cried Sarah, glad to be in smooth
water again. “You are Goldilocks’ mother, Gray Lady,
and you are our General’s daughter and you live in his
house!” Then, realizing that she had given play to her
own fancy rather than stated the facts expected, she fled
to her desk and hid her face behind its lid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No reproof followed her as she expected, but instead the
pleasant voice again said: “Thank you, Sarah; I like the
name you have given me better than my very own, and if
you all know where to find the General’s house, you know
where to find me,” and when Sarah, gaining courage,
looked up again, she saw, what the others did not notice,
that the gray eyes were brimming, though there was a
smile on her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, children, what would you like to hear about
this afternoon? Miss Wilde told me that she had
intended giving you a spelling review and writing
exercise of some kind, but that we might finish the day
as we choose. Shall I read you a story, or would you like
to ask questions and talk best?—one at a time, of course!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talk—you talk,” shouted a vigorous chorus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, Tommy Todd,” said Gray Lady, “why
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
do you sit in the middle with the girls instead of on the
outer row with the boys, where there is more room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy, placed between Sarah Barnes and his own
sister, started half up in his seat and looked all round the
room as if seeking a way of escape, and finding none, dropped
his gaze to his desk and sat mute with a very red face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question was repeated—still no answer. A hand
flew up. “I know,” piped the voice of one of the little
ones in front; “it’s ’cause Tommy can’t keep his eyes inside
the winder if he’s by it; he’s always spying out at ground-hogs
and crows and askin’ teacher questions about the
birds setting on the wires, so he don’t mind his books and
teacher don’t know the answers to all he asks, an’ it gives
her the headache!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Tommy,” said Gray Lady, who had learned that
at least one of the children before her cared for out-of-doors,
which was precisely what she wanted to know,
“as long as this is a sort of holiday, suppose you take
that empty seat by the east window and tell us what you
see. You may open the window and the others on that
side also, for I think the rain is over; yes, the clouds are
breaking away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How fresh and sweet the air was that rushed into the
close room! Tommy stuck his head out and took a great
breath as he looked down over the corn-fields,—his enemies
the crows were not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t much to see now, it’s too wet yet,” he
said; “but pretty soon there will be, for most birds and
things get hungry right after a rain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Olit—olit—olit—che-wiss-ch-wiss-war,” sang a
little bird in a low bush by the roadside.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
“What bird is that,” asked Gray Lady; “do any of you
know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just the usually little brown bird that stays around
here most all the time, but I love the tune it sings,” said
Sarah Barnes. “Teacher says it’s some kind of a sparrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='song1'></a>It is a Song Sparrow,” said Gray Lady, “and you
are right in saying it stays with us almost all the year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” called Tommy, “the birds are beginning to
come out; some <a id='barnsw1'></a>Barn Swallows are flying over the low
meadow and there’s a lot of ’em, and another kind strung
along the wires on the turnpike. They always sit close
and act that way all this month and some fly away, and
’long the first part of next month, when the corn’s all
husked, they’ll be gone! Please, ma’am, why do some
birds never go away, and some do, and what makes ’em
come back?” Then Tommy began one of the volley of
questions that Miss Wilde so dreaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, an’ please, ma’am,” asked Dave, “why are some
birds that mate together such different colours?” “An’
what becomes of <a id='bobo1'></a>Bobolinks after Fourth of July?” asked
another. “An’ what makes birds have so many kind
of feet?” queried a third.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then questions flew so thick and fast that Gray Lady
could not even hear herself think, and presently, when every
one had laughed at the confusion, order was restored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I asked you a moment ago what you would like to
hear about. I think I know. You would like to hear
about birds! Are there any other boys here besides
Tommy and Dave who care about birds?” asked Gray
Lady, who wished to have each child feel that he or she
had a part in what was going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
“I know about birds’ eggs!” cried Bobby Bates, a boy
who, from being undersized, looked much younger than
he really was; “I’ve got a pint fruit-jar of robins’ eggs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’ve got a quart jar of mixed eggs,” said Dave, “and
they’re mostly little ones, Wrens and Chippy birds and
such like, so’s I’ve really got more’n Bobby!” he added
boastfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady opened her lips to speak sharply and her
eyes flashed, for nest-robbing was one of the things she
most detested. Then she remembered that perhaps these
children had not only never even dreamed that there was
any harm in it, but had never heard of the laws that wise
people had made to protect the eggs of wild birds, as well
as the birds themselves, from harm. So she hesitated a
moment while she thought how she might best make the
matter understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you like to collect eggs?” she asked. “Because
they are pretty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m, partly,” drawled Dave, “and then to see how
many I can get in a spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do you never think how you worry the mother
birds by stealing their eggs, and how many more birds
there would be if you let the eggs hatch out? What the
rhyme says is true,—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“ ‘The blue eggs in the Robin’s nest</p>
<p class='line0'>Will soon have beak and wings and breast,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And flutter and fly away!’</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Only think, if all those robins’ eggs of yours, Bobby, and
all your little eggs, Dave, should suddenly turn into birds
and fly about the room, how many there would be! But
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
now they will never have wings and swell their throats
to sing to us and use their beaks to eat up insects
that make the apples wormy and curl up the leaves of the
great shade trees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='rob1'></a>Robins don’t do any good; they just spoil our berries
and grapes; dad says so, and he shoots ’em whenever he
can, and he likes me to take the eggs,” said Dave, stubbornly,
while Sarah Barnes exclaimed, “Yes, an’ <span class='it'>my</span>
father says he ought to be ashamed of himself!” almost
out loud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that Robins sometimes eat fruit,” said Gray
Lady, firmly, “but they do so much more good by destroying
bugs that the Wise Men say that neither they nor their
eggs shall be taken or destroyed, and what they say is
now a law. So that it is not for any one to do as he pleases
in the matter. To kill song-birds or destroy their eggs
is as much breaking the law as if you stole a man’s horse
or cow, for these birds are not yours; they belong to the
state in which you live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby and Dave looked surprised, but Tommy and
Sarah nodded to one another, as much as to say, “We knew
that, didn’t we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some day, if you are clever with your lessons so that
Miss Wilde can spare the time for it, I will tell you all
about the reasons for these laws, and what the wild birds
do for us, and what we should do for them. But first you
must learn to know the names of some of the birds that
live and visit hereabout, as I am now learning yours, and
make friends of some of them as I hope to make friends
of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, oh, yes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
“You can’t make friends of birds; they won’t let you,”
said Dave Drake, who was a sickly, lanky boy of fourteen
with a whining voice; “they always fly away. That is, I
mean tree birds, not chickens nor pigeons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chickens aren’t birds, they’re only young hens,” put
in Eliza Clausen, with an expression of withering contempt.
She was one of the big fourteen-year-old girls, and not
being a good scholar was apt to use opposition in the place
of information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can make friends of at least some birds,” said
Gray Lady, “if we are kind to them. When we have
human visitors come to stay with us, what do we do for
them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We let them sleep in the best bedroom, and we get
out the best china and have awful good things to eat,
and give ’em a good time,” said Ruth Barnes, all in one
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and we should do much the same with our bird
friends. They do not need to have a bedroom prepared;
they can generally find that for themselves, though even
this is sometimes necessary in bad weather; but they
often need food, and in order that they should have what
Ruth calls ‘a good time,’ we must let them alone and
not interfere with their comings and goings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go softly to the west window and look out,” continued
Gray Lady, raising a finger to caution silence, for from
her seat on the little platform she could see over the children’s
heads and out both door and windows, “and see
the hungry visitors that a little food has brought to the
very door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children tiptoed to one side of the room, and there,
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
lo and behold, was a great <a id='jay1'></a>Blue Jay, a Robin, a Downy
Woodpecker with his clean black-and-white-striped coat
and red neck bow, and a saucy Chickadee, with his jaunty
black cap and white tie, all feasting on the broken bits of
Miss Wilde’s ham sandwich, while a pair of Robins were
industriously picking the fruit from a remnant of huckleberry
pie. Unfortunately, before the children had taken
more than a good look, the door banged to and the birds
flew away, the Woodpecker giving his wild sort of laugh,
the Robins crying, “Quick! quick!” in great alarm,
while the Jay and Chickadee told their own names plainly
as they flew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As we have agreed to talk and ask questions, I will
ask the first one,” said Gray Lady, as they all settled
down, feeling very good-natured and eager to listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eliza said a few minutes ago that a chicken isn’t a
bird. Now a chicken is a bird, though of course all birds
are not chickens.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>The Bird</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Who can tell me exactly what a bird is? You all may
think you know, but can you put it in words?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bird isn’t a plant; it is an animal,” said Tommy
Todd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but a cat is an animal, and a snake, and a horse;
and we are animals ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bird is a flying animal,” returned Sarah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very true, but so is a bat, and, as you know, a bat
has fur and looks very like a mouse, and a bird does not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you give it up. Very well, listen and remember.
<span class='it'>A bird is the only animal which has feathers!</span> With his
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
hollow bones filled with buoyant, warm air, and covered
with these strong pinions, he rows through the air, as we
row a boat through the water with the oars, balancing
himself with these wings, also steering himself with them
and with his tail made of stiff feathers and shaped to his
particular need, while with small feathers laid close, overlapping
each other like shingles, and bedded on an under-coat
of down, he is clothed and protected from heat, cold,
and wet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The eye of the bird is different from ours, for it
magnifies and makes objects appear much larger to it
than they do to us. Also, while with other animals each
group has practically the same kind of feet or beaks,
birds have these two features built on widely different
plans, so that when you have learned to know the common
birds by name and are really studying bird-life, you
will find that you must be guided to the orders in which
they belong often by their beaks and feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barnyard Ducks, as you know, have webbed toes for
swimming, and flat bills to aid them in shovelling their
natural food from the mud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Birds of prey, like the Hawks and Owls, have strong
hooked beaks and powerful talons or claws, for seizing
and tearing the small animals upon which they feed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Woodpeckers (all but one) have two front and
two hind toes; these help them grasp the tree bark firmly
as they rest, while they have strong-cutting, chisel-like
beaks, which they also use for tapping or drumming their
rolling love-songs.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i053.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0004' style='width:70%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>CHICKADEE</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“While the insect-eating song-birds have more or less
slender bills and four toes, three in front and one behind,
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
for perching crosswise on small branches, the seed-eating
songsters, such as Sparrows, have similar feet, but short,
stout, cone-shaped bills for cracking seeds and small nuts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By this you can see that in spite of the fact that all
birds wear feathers, and have wings, a tail, beak, and a
pair of legs, they may still be very different from each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Turkey Gobbler doesn’t look much like a Robin, nor
a Goose like a Swallow, yet they are all four birds! They
all four bring forth their young from eggs; but the little
Turkeys and Goslings are covered with feathers when they
peep out of the shell and are able to walk, while the young
Robins and Swallows are at first blind, naked, and helpless;
so here again you can see that there is something
special to be learned about every bird that flies or swims.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chickadee-dee-dee!<a id='cdee1'></a> Can’t you tell them something
about me?” said this dear little bird, flitting about one
of the open windows and clinging upside down to the blind
slats that were bare of paint, like either a Woodpecker,
or, as Tommy Todd remarked, “the man in the circus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The little bird peeping in the window and calling his
name reminds me of a pretty poem about him,” said Gray
Lady. “I will repeat it to you and write it on the board
so that you can copy it in your books, and then some of
you may like to learn it to surprise Miss Wilde on another
rainy Friday.”</p>

<p class='line0'>He has a tiny helpmeet, too, who wears a gown and cap,</p>
<p class='line0'>And is so very wide-awake, she seldom takes a nap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that I have answered my own question, there
was another that one of you asked, or rather a pair of
questions. Why do some birds go away in autumn, and
why do they come back? It is very important to know
the answers to these, if we want to really understand
about the lives of birds and the trials and dangers they
undergo.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span><span class='it'>The Bird Year and the Migration</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“People who think of birds at all know that they are
not equally plentiful at all times of the year, but that
they have their seasons of coming and disappearing, as
the flowers have, though not for exactly the same reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are accustomed to see the plants send up shoots
through the bare ground every spring, unfold their leaves
and blossoms, and, finally, after perfecting seed, wither
away again at the touch of frost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of these plants, as well as some large trees, a few are
more hardy than others, like the ground-pine, laurel, and
wintergreen, and are able to hold their leaves through very
cold weather, and we call them evergreens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You notice that the birds appear in spring even before
the pussy-willows bud out, and that every morning when
you wake, the music outside the window and down among
the alders on the meadow border is growing louder, until
by the time the apple trees are in bloom there seems to be
a bird for every tree, bush, and tuft of sedgegrass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the time the timothy is cut and rye harvested, you
do not hear so great a variety of song. The Robin, Song
Sparrow, House Wren, and Meadowlark are still in good
voice, and an occasional Catbird, but the Bobolink has
dropped out, and the Brown Thrasher no longer tells the
farmer how to plant his corn: ‘Drop it, drop it, cover it
up, hoe it, hoe it;’ and very wise he is, too, for the corn
is all planted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Later still, when the stacked cornstalks fill the fields
with their wigwams, like Indian encampments, the pumpkins
are gathered in golden heaps, and the smoke of
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
burning leaves and brush pervades the air, you hear very
few bird songs, for many birds have either dropped
silently out of sight or collected in huge flocks, like the
Swallow, swept by, and disappeared in the clouds, while
others, like the Purple Grackle or Common Crow-Blackbird,—walk
over the stubble and cover the trees, making
such a creaking, crackling noise that one would surely
think that their wings as well as voices were rusty and
needed oiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has become of the birds? Where do they go
when they disappear?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Being warm-blooded animals they cannot dive into the
mud and hide, like fishes, or crawl into cracks of tree
bark and wrap themselves up in cocoons, like insects.
Neither do they drop their feathers and die away as tender
plants drop their leaves and disappear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People once believed that Swallows dived through the
water into the mud, where they rolled themselves into
balls and slept all winter. They thought this because
Swallows are seen in early autumn in flocks about ponds
and marshes, where they feed upon the insects that
abound in such places. People thought that as Swallows
were last seen in these places before they disappeared they
must have gone under the water; but this was merely
guessing, which is a very dangerous thing to do when
trying to find out the plans that Nature makes for her
great family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Later yet, when the snow begins to fall, there is little or
no bird music, only the hoot of an Owl, the shrill cry of the
Hawks, the ‘quank, quank’ of the Nuthatch, that runs up
and down the tree-trunks like a mouse in gray-and-white
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
feathers, the jeer of the Jay, and the soft voice of the
Chickadee that, as you have just heard, tells you his
name so prettily as he peers at you from beneath his
little black cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the Catbird, Wren, Bobolink, Oriole, the Cuckoo
that helped clear the tent caterpillars from the orchard,
the Chat that puzzled the dogs by whistling like their
master, the beautiful Barn Swallow, with the swift wings,
that had his plaster nest in the hayloft, the Phœbe that
built in the cowshed, and the dainty Humming-bird that
haunted the honeysuckle on the porch and hummed an
ancient spinning-song to us with his wings,—where are
they all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why is it that while those have disappeared, some
few birds still remain with us in spite of cold and snow?”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>The Fall Migration</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
“If you watch the birds, you will soon notice that some
eat only animal food, in the shape of various bugs, worms,
and lice, while others eat seeds of various weeds, and
grasses, and also berries. There are many birds that, like
ourselves, eat a little of everything, both animal and
vegetable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For instance, the Swallows live on insects of the air,
except sometimes in the autumn flocking they feed for a
short time on bayberries. The <a id='phe1'></a>Phœbe is an insect eater;
also the <a id='cat1'></a>Catbird, though he is fond of strawberries and
cherries for dessert. You saw just now that the Chickadee,
Woodpecker, and Jay preferred the meat from the sandwich
and the Robins the berries from the pie, though the
Jay also likes nuts and seeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know that when frost comes, the air-flying insects
are killed, and the gnats, mosquitoes, and flies that have
worried the horses and cattle disappear. For this reason
the birds that depend upon these bugs must follow their
food supply, and move off farther southward where frost
has not yet come.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
“This is the reason why so many birds who feed on
winged insects leave us in early autumn, before it is cold
enough to make them uncomfortable; they must follow
their food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are other birds that, when they no longer have
nestlings to feed, can pick up a living from berries and
seeds, like the Robin, or live the greater part of the season
upon seeds, like the Sparrows. These birds are not driven
away by the first frost, but many stay about until the
weather is uncomfortably cold, and some few remain all
winter, like the Meadowlarks, Nuthatches, Jays, and
Woodpeckers, who, having stout beaks, can dig out grubs
and insects from among the roots of grass and from tough
tree bark; but these too must move on if ice coats the
trees or snow buries their ground feeding-places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a great many birds spend the nesting season north
of New England, they pass by on their way southward,
and, if the feeding is good, stay with us sometimes several
weeks, so that the flocks of Robins seen here in October
are likely to be those that nested in the north, while our
own birds are gradually drifting down to the extreme south,
where they winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This great southward journey of the birds, that begins
as early as August and lasts at some seasons, if the winter
is open, almost until Christmas, is called the fall migration,
and when it is over, the birds remaining with us are classed
as Winter Residents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is another thing to be seen at this time of year,
and if you have not already noticed it, watch and you will see
that many of the birds that wore bright feathers in May
and June have changed their gay coats for duller feathers.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>The Moulting</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
“After the nesting season is over, and a pair of birds have
raised one, two, and, as with the Wrens, sometimes three
broods, the feathers of the parents become worn and
broken, and not fit for winter covering, nor are the wing
quills strong enough for the fall flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At this time, when the young birds are able to care for
themselves, the pairs no longer keep alone together, but,
leaving their nesting-haunts, travel about either in a
family party or in larger friendly flocks, and, although
some birds, like the Song Sparrow and Meadowlark, sing
throughout the season, the general morning chorus and
the nesting season end together, in early or middle July.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is quite difficult to name the birds when young and
old travel in flocks, for when a male is bright-coloured
and the female dull, the first coat of the young is often
such a mixture of both that it is easily mistaken for a
wholly different and strange bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In August or September almost all of our birds change
their spring feathers. This is called moulting. And the
brightly coloured birds often drop their wedding finery
for dull-coloured travelling cloaks, so that they may not
be seen when they fly southward through the falling
leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After this season <a id='tan1'></a>Father Tanager, of the scarlet wedding
coat with black sleeves, appears in yellowish-green, like
his wife, and the little Tanagers sometimes have mixed
green, yellow, and red garments, for all the world like
patchwork bedquilts pieced without regard to pattern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The jolly <a id='bobo2'></a>Bobolink, also, who in May was the prize
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
singer of the meadows, and disported in a coat of black,
white, and buff, now wears dull brown stripes, and, having
forgotten his song, he mixes with the young of the
year and becomes merely the Reed Bird of the gunners.
But in early spring he will change again, and, before the
nesting time, reappear among us with every black feather
polished free from rusty edges and glistening as of old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When Father Tanager comes back, he is brave and red
again, though it takes little Tommy Tanager two moultings
to grow an equally red coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even with the more quietly marked birds their colours
are less distinct after the summer moult, so that what
is known as the bird’s perfect or typical plumage is in
many species that of the nesting season alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t think that there was so much to know about
birds; they seem to have ways of doing things just like
people. I’d love to know all about them every Friday,
but I suppose that’s too nice to happen,” said Sarah
Barnes, as Gray Lady paused and moved her chair
back from the bright light that was now shining through
the door directly in her face, for the clouds had rolled
away down behind the hills, leaving one of the clear, bright,
early September afternoons when the sun lends its colour
to the field of early goldenrod, until sunset seems to reach
to one’s very feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t <span class='it'>too</span> nice to happen,” said Gray Lady,
laughing; “but it would certainly be very pleasant for
me, also, if Miss Wilde could give you to me for an hour
or so every other Friday, then perhaps some other day
you could come to the General’s house and return my
call, and see all the birds and pictures and books that
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
belonged to my Goldilocks’ father. How would you like
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bully!” cried Tommy Todd, “and there’s more kinds
of birds in the General’s old orchard than anywhere else
hereabout. I haven’t ever taken any eggs from there,”
he added hastily, “only jest peeked and watched, an’
once I got a three-story nest from there, along late in the
fall when the birds were done with it. If I brought it
along, ma’am, could you tell me what sort of a bird it
belongs to? I can’t find out!” he added eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think I can tell you,” Gray Lady answered,
“and I’m very glad if you know about my orchard and
its tenants, because very likely you may be able to introduce
me to some that I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, children, before next week is over I will see
Miss Wilde and tell her my plans, but one thing I will tell
you now—I have a little daughter Elizabeth, whom
Sarah Barnes calls Goldilocks. She is twelve years old,
but because of an accident her back is not strong, and
instead of running about as you do she has had to be
wheeled about in a chair. I have taken her to the best
doctors, and they say that she is getting well slowly, and
that now all that she needs is to live out-of-doors and be
with children of her own age, who will be kind and gentle
to her, yet treat her as one of themselves. She cannot
bear to hear of anything being killed or hurt, and she has
been loved so well all her life that she loves everything in
return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come to the General’s house and help Goldilocks
to grow strong and forget all the pain she has
suffered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
“Yes, <span class='it'>ma’am</span>,” came the reply as with one voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sarah Barnes had the honour of taking Gray Lady’s
hand as she went to the carriage, and Tommy Todd closed
the door without any one giving him a hint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, before closing the schoolhouse for the night, his
special duty, he began a hunt for the rat-trap, which he
soon found in the wood-box, but instead of taking the
rats home as usual for Mike, his father’s terrier, to “have
fun” with, he drowned them as quickly as possible in the
brook that ran below the hill, for he thought to himself
as they were things that must be killed Goldilocks would
think this the kindest way.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span><h1>IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE ORCHARD PARTY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Not only did Miss Wilde hear every detail of Gray
Lady’s visit from her scholars, but the middle of the
following week she received a letter from Gray Lady
herself as well as one from the president of the school
board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady wrote that if she could succeed in interesting
the children of the school at Foxes Corners in the birds
and little animals about, then she meant to arrange
another season so that the other four schools in the scattered
district might have the same opportunity. For
this reason she had asked and obtained leave of the school
committee to have two Friday afternoons of each month
given to the purpose. She also promised to send some
bird books and pictures to the school and a large wall
map of North America, so that after the children had
learned to know a bird by sight and name they might
trace its journeys the year through, and thus realize to
what perils it is exposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then followed the most interesting part of the letter to
Miss Wilde and her children, and this is what it said:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all very well to show children pictures and read them
stories about the birds and tell them that it is their duty to be
kind to them, but I wish them also to see and judge for themselves
and learn to love their bird neighbours because they can’t
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
help themselves. This is best done outdoors and under the
trees, and there is no such charming place to meet the birds and
be introduced to them as in an old apple orchard such as ours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course at this season birds are growing fewer every day,
but this makes it all the easier to name those that remain, with
less chance of confusion than in spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I propose to have an Orchard Party next Saturday, and I
should be happy to have you bring as many of your pupils as
possible to spend the day here. We will have luncheon in the
orchard and the children will find there many bird-homes that
the tenants have left, that will show them that man is not the
only housebuilder and thoughtful parent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there are any children who do not care to come, pray do
not force them in any way, but if possible let me know by Friday
morning how many I may expect.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was Wednesday when Miss Wilde told the children
of the invitation, just before she rang the bell for noon
recess. Then she asked all those who wished to go to
the Orchard Party to stand up, and instantly thirteen of
the fifteen present were on their feet, the two exceptions
being Eliza and Dave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Wilde of course noticed this. However, she said
nothing about it, knowing that with these two discontented
ones the reason would be told before long and that
very plainly. But when they returned from dinner she
gave each one a sheet of clean paper and told them to
write answers either of acceptance or regret, as they felt
inclined, to Gray Lady, first writing a short note upon the
blackboard herself so that they might see how to begin
and end, and where to put the date, because some children
who can spell separate words do not know how to put
them together so as to express clearly and concisely what
they wish to say in a note.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
Soon thirteen pens were scratching away industriously,
while Eliza and Dave fingered theirs, fidgeted with the
paper, and wriggled in their seats as if uncertain what to
say or whether they would write at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally the teacher said, “If any one of you is needed
at home on Saturday or cannot for any other reason go
to the party, you may write that, but each child must
send a reply; and be very careful, for I shall send the notes
as they are written without corrections.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sarah Barnes was deputed to collect the papers, and
after school was dismissed Miss Wilde glanced over the
notes before enclosing them in one large envelope. Eliza’s
read:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I would like to go to the party but my ma says to look at
birds is silly and that when folks looks much at birds they get
afraid to trim their hats with them, and my ma and me has
birds on our Sunday hats and they look tastie, and we don’t
want to get afraid so there’s no use in my going to the party
’xcept to eat the lunch, which wouldn’t be fare.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Wilde’s first impulse was to leave out this curiously
worded and badly spelled letter; then, as she read
it a second time she smiled and said to herself, “Who
knows but what this note will give Gray Lady a good
idea of the other side of the question and of the objections
she will meet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dave’s note was no more agreeable, though expressed
rather more clearly:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to go up to your house, but when I told father bout
the other day and you wanting us not to get birds’ eggs, he says
he knows what some people want, and next thing will be to
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
get me to sign that I won’t go trappin or shootin nothin, and
spoiling my fun, and birds are only knuisances, except the kinds
we can eat.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This note also went with the others, but by Friday
morning the two children, who had heard nothing talked
of for two days but the party, began to wish that they
were going, Eliza especially, for her mother said that
morning, “You weren’t smart to refuse; you could have
had a peep inside the General’s house, maybe, and I don’t
believe she’d dassed said a word about birds on hats,
with one of the company wearing ’em!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Friday afternoon, when Miss Wilde asked the children
to meet her at the hedge half a mile above the schoolhouse
at ten o’clock the following morning, so that they might
take a short cut across the fields, she noticed that Eliza
and Dave hung behind the others, who as usual raced off
in different directions toward home, and then Eliza, who
was walking beside her, mumbled something about “wishing
she hadn’t refused and supposing that it was too
late now,” etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, it is not very polite to change one’s mind
about an invitation,” said the teacher, “but Gray Lady
wrote me last night that if you and Dave should feel
differently about wishing to come, I might bring you,
but that after to-morrow it would be too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At ten o’clock this bright September morning Gray
Lady came out on the porch of the big white house, with
the row of columns in front, that was known the country-side
over as “the General’s.” There was a wide lawn
in front of the house and on either side, arched by old elms,
the leaves of which were now turning yellow, but there had
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
been no frost and the flowers in the buds were still
bright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Back of the house was a flower garden, with grape and
rose arbours on either side, under which chairs and little
tables were placed invitingly. Beyond this garden was a
maze of fruit bushes and the young orchard, and beyond
this the old orchard, now running half wild, stretched downhill
toward the river woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lovelier place could not have been planned for either
children or birds, or the people who love both, nor a more
perfect place for all three to live together in peace and
comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goldilocks was already out, and her faithful Ann Hughes
was pushing her chair to and fro, for when one is eager
and impatient it is very hard to have to sit still. Goldilocks
was growing stronger every day and could walk a
few yards all alone, but it tired her, and her mother
thought the excitement of seeing so many children would
be enough for one day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently a head, with a cap on it, bobbed up over the
last hump in the road below the house, and then another
with a ribbon-trimmed hat upon it, the pair belonging to
Tommy Todd and Sarah Barnes, who led the procession;
and in a few minutes more the entire group had reached
the porch and Sarah Barnes was repeating their names
to Goldilocks. The five boys rather hung back, but
that was to be expected of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a little later Gray Lady led the way down to the
garden, she turned to Ann and gave her some directions
for the house and was going to push the chair herself
when Tommy Todd came forward and seized the handle,
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
saying earnestly, “I can do that first-rate. When dad
fell out of the haymow and broke his leg, I used to tote
him all round the farm, and never bumped him a bit,—only
in ploughed land and off roads you’ve got to go jest
so easy.” And to illustrate he raised the front wheels of
the chair and bearing on the handles lowered them again
as they left the garden path for the rough grass-grown
track that led to the orchard. Goldilocks looked up and
smiled at him, and then at Sarah and Miss Wilde, who
walked one on each side, neither of the four dreaming
at that moment how much happier their lives would be
because they had met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, the bars are gone and there is a brand new gate!”
exclaimed Sarah Barnes, as they reached the opening in
the stone fence that had been spanned by rough-hewn
bars ever since she could remember. There, between
strong cedar posts, hung a rustic gate, and above it was a
double arch of the same material, into which the word
BIRDLAND was interwoven in small sticks of the same
wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a surprise that Jacob Hughes made for to-day,
for this is my birthday party, you see, and some day mother
is going to have a flagpole for Birdland with an eagle on
top. Jacob is Ann’s brother,” she continued by way of
explanation. “He used to be a sailor once, but now he’s
come to live with us always. He is a carpenter, too, and
he can whittle almost anything with his knife, and he
makes the most beautiful bird-houses. I should really
like to live in one myself—that is, of course, if I were a
bird!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you were a bird you’d be a bluebird, I guess,” said
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
Sarah Barnes, as she glanced at the deep blue sailor suit,
with the crimson shield in front, that Goldilocks wore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather be a big owl,” said Tommy Todd, “and sit
up in a tree in the woods and call out ‘Woo-oo-oo’ when
people go by in the dark and scare ’em.” And he gave
such a good imitation of an owl’s hoot that Bruce, the
Collie dog, who always either walked or sat beside Goldilocks’
chair, began to bark and circle wildly about, nose
in air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m very sure I shouldn’t care to be an owl, for then
I should have to eat meadow-mice and moles, and swallow
them, fur and all, and that would taste so mussy,” said
Goldilocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it came about that all the children were in very good
humour when they entered Birdland on Goldilocks’ birthday,
and Gray Lady smiled happily as she looked at the
group with her precious daughter in the midst and thought
that her experiment had begun with a happy omen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though many of the apples that grew on the trees of
the old orchard would not have taken prizes at the
country fair, they looked very tempting to the youngsters,—Baldwins,
Spitzenburghs, and russets of two sorts, the
green and the golden, were still on the trees, but there
were great heaps of earlier varieties on the ground, and
Jacob and another man were busy sorting them over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reading in the children’s eager faces what they would
like to do, Gray Lady said, “You may run off now and
have all the apples you want, and an hour for playing
‘hide-and-seek,’ ‘red lion,’ or ‘Indians,’ in all the orchard
and meadows and woodland yonder, and then when you
hear a horn blow come back and you will find us over in
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
the corner where the table and seats are placed.” Then,
seeing that some of the girls had brought wraps or jackets
with them, and also that the Sunday-best hats that they
wore would be in the way of romping, Gray Lady told
them to hang them on the tree nearest where she and
Miss Wilde were seated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first Sarah and Tommy were not going with the
others, but Goldilocks insisted that they should leave her
in a gap where the rows of trees formed a long lane through
which she could see across the meadows to the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These two children were quite at home in this neighbourhood,
for had there not been a particular gap in the
old fence through which they had taken a “short cut”
down to the village ever since they could remember?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if Goldilocks knows that Quail nest in this
brush and scratch around here like chickens,” said
Tommy, as they left the orchard for the meadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and you got that three-story nest of yours last
fall in the bough-apple tree,” said Sarah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza and Dave soon forgot all about their reasons for
having at first refused to go to the party, and when they
heard the horn tooting it seemed so soon that they could
hardly believe that it was noon and luncheon time. And
such a luncheon as it was! Around the trunk of the
largest tree in the orchard, four tables were so placed that
when covered they looked like one big table, with the tree
growing through the centre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white cloth was bordered with russet and gold beech
leaves, bleached ferns, and the deep red leaves of maples
and oaks; grapes and oranges were piled high in baskets
made of hollowed-out watermelons. Hard-boiled eggs
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
were arranged in nests built of narrow, dainty sandwiches,
little iced cakes rested upon plates of braided corn-husks,
and Goldilocks’ birthday cake, with its twelve candles, was
ornamented with little doves made of white sugar. When,
last and best of all, the ice-cream appeared, without which
no party is complete, it was in the form of a large white
hen with a very red comb, while from beneath her peeped
ice-cream eggs of many colours, chocolate-brown, pistachio-green,
lemon-yellow, and strawberry-red, the nest being
woven of spun sugar that so closely resembled fine straw
that it was not until the children had tasted it that they
were convinced that it really was candy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Country children are usually very silent when on their
good behaviour, but such ice-cream had never been heard
of either at Foxes Corners, the Centre, or the near-by
manufacturing town, and muffled “ohs” and “ahs” of
satisfaction would break out until, Miss Wilde having given
no rebuking glance, a perfect babble of enthusiasm arose
that lasted until the meal was ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what <span class='it'>is</span> that?” asked Ruth Banks, glancing as
she spoke toward a very old tree that, having partly
blown over, was resting on four of its branches that served
as legs and made it appear like some strange goblin animal.
On the upper side of this fallen tree, built around
an upright branch, was a platform made of old wood with
the bark on, and on the different sections of this were
peanuts, shelled corn, pounded up dog crackers and
buckwheat, while on a series of blunt spikes driven into
the branch, were some lumps of suet and bits of bacon
rind. As Ruth spoke a little black-and-white bird, with
short tail and legs, was picking vigorously at the suet,
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
using his stout bill with the quick sharp blows of a
hammer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That? Oh—” said Goldilocks, “that is another
birthday surprise that mother and Jake made for me.
That is, mother planned it, and Jake did the work. It is
a birds’ lunch-counter, and this winter we are going to
keep all the different kinds of food on it that the birds
like, so that they need never leave us because they are
hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s lots of things all around now that they can
eat,” said Tommy Todd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course, but we want them to become accustomed
to the table, to know where the food is before they
need it and think about going away, and wild birds are
always suspicious of new things,” said Gray Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one more feature of the luncheon, but, as it
was something that could not be put upon the table, it
was hung in the tree overhead. This thing looked like
a great bunch of gayly coloured autumn leaves tied tight
together, and from it hung a number of red strings, as
many in fact as there were people at the party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady explained that each child in turn was to pull
a string and, as they held back as if in doubt as to the
result, she herself pulled the first cord and out dropped
from the ball a long motto in yellow-fringed paper that,
on being unrolled, contained beside the snapper a little
paper roll on which was printed, “I am Mazulm, the
Night Owl,” and when Gray Lady carefully unfolded the
paper it proved to be a cap with strings, shaped like an
owl’s head, which seemed to the children to wink its yellow
tinsel eyes as Gray Lady placed it upon her fluffy hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
Then everybody pulled a string, and soon there hopped
about a startling array of birds with human legs and arms,
for every one entered fully into the fun of the thing, even
quiet Miss Wilde wearing her Blue Jay cap and calling
the bird’s note with good effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now run about and see all that you can before playtime
is over, and we go into the study for our first bird
lesson,” said Gray Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we could have a lunch-counter for birds at our
school,” said Sarah, “but we haven’t any near-by tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you may be able to have one—a tree is not
always necessary. I have several ideas for lunch-counters
in my scrap-book,” said Gray Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the children walked along, some swung their hats
by the elastics in rhythm with their steps. The elastic
of Eliza Clausen’s hat was new and strong and all of a
sudden it gave a snap, and the hat flew into Goldilocks’
lap. She had stretched out her hand to return it to its
owner when she glanced at the hat, and her whole face
changed and the smile faded from her lips. “Oh, Eliza!”
she exclaimed appealingly, “you don’t know that those
feathers on your hat are wings of dear, lovely Barn Swallows,
or you wouldn’t wear it, would you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course I do,” said Eliza, taken off her guard and at
heart now provoked and ashamed at having her hat seen,
“and I’ve got lots more kinds at home. Ma’s got feathers
on her hat, too—tasty feathers. Miss Barker from New
York that boarded with us gave ’em to her; they cost a
lot and stick right up in a nice stiff long bunch. They’re
called regrets, and they don’t grow round here, but they’re
ever so stylish.” And Eliza held her nose in the air with a
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
sniff of scorn, a vulgar travesty that the pounding of her
heart belied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think those stiff regret feathers in your mother’s
hat are stylish,” said Sarah Barnes, quickly taking up the
cudgels; “I think they look like fish bones!” Then
Eliza began to cry, and both Goldilocks and Sarah looked
distressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady hesitated a moment and then said, “Eliza,
dear, I’m sorry that this has happened just now. It is
not generally a good plan for us to criticise one another’s
clothing or habits, but there are times when it is necessary.
Sooner or later I should have told you the reasons why
people who stop to think and have kind hearts are no
longer willing to wear the feathers of wild birds, and I’m
sure that presently, when you stop and think, you will see
that it is so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they all walked very quietly up to the library
that had belonged to Goldilocks’ father, and when they
were seated and had time to look about they saw that the
walls above the book-cases were covered by pictures of
birds in their natural colours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the table at one end of the room were piled some
books, and by this Gray Lady seated herself, her scrap-book
by her elbow,—a book, by the way, with which, before another
season, they were to become as well acquainted as
with their friend herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy Todd could not take his eyes from a picture
of a tall white bird, with long neck and legs and a graceful
sweep of slender feathers that drooped from its back over
the tail. Holding up his hand, which at school always
means that you wish to ask a question, Tommy said,
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
“Please, what is that bird’s name? There’s a big, dark,
gray one, shaped something like it, that I’ve seen by the
mill-pond, but it’s not half so pretty. I’ve never seen one
like this, here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='egret1'></a>That bird,” said Gray Lady, “is the Snowy Heron,
Egret, or <span class='it'>Re</span>gret Bird, as Eliza called it a few minutes
ago, and I think that you will agree that the name is a
very suitable one when I tell you the bird’s story.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span><h1>V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>REASONS WHY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When the children had satisfied their curiosity by
looking about the room at the pictures and stuffed birds
in cases as much as they wished and were comfortably
seated, Gray Lady drew a chair into the midst of the
group and began to talk, not a bit like a teacher in school,
but as if she had dropped in among them to have a little
chat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When one has looked at something from one side all
one’s life it is hard to realize that there is another,” she
said, smiling brightly at Eliza and Dave, who chanced to
be sitting together and who looked not only unhappy but
very sullen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have always happened to be with people who love
everything that lives and grows. They have always
been kind to birds because it never occurred to them to
be otherwise. In watching them and learning their ways,
they also learned that these winged beings had another
value beside that of beauty of colour and song, that by
fulfilling their destiny and eating many destructive bugs
and animals they not only earn their own livelihood but
help keep us all alive by protecting the farmers’ crops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus, when I went down to the school at Foxes Corners,
I took it too much for granted that you all cared for
birds and would naturally wish to protect them. I thought
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
that all I had to do was to try to tell you interesting stories
that would help you to remember the names and habits of
the various birds. But Eliza’s hat, and a little note that
I received from one of the boys which showed that he and
his family considered all birds that are not good to eat
as worse than useless, show me that some of you look at
birds from another side. Those that do certainly have
a right to, as a lawyer would say, have the case argued
before them so that they may see for themselves why
they are on the wrong side of the tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The birds were on the earth before man came, and in
those far-back times they were able to look after and
protect themselves, because the warfare they waged was
only with animals often less intelligent than themselves.
Do you remember the beautiful allegory of the creation
of this earth written in Genesis which is also written
and proven in the records the geologists find buried in the
earth, and quarry from the rocks themselves?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When man came, in order that he might live comfortably
and safely, many of his improvements brought death
to his feathered friends. Take, for example, two objects
that you all know,—the lighthouse at the end of the bar
by the harbour head, and the telegraph and telephone
wires that follow the highway near your schoolhouse.
Men have need of both these things, and yet, in their travels
on dark nights, thousands of birds, by flying toward the
bright tower light that seems to promise them safety,
or coming against the innumerable wires, are dashed to
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of all the mounted birds that you see in the cases there,
not one was deliberately killed by my husband, but they
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
were picked up and sent to him by various lighthouse
keepers along the coast who knew his interest and that he
would gladly pay them for their trouble. By and by, when
we come to the stories of the flight of some of those birds,
you will be amazed to see what frail little things have
ventured miles away in their travels; even tiny Humming-birds
came to my husband in this way. This danger
grows greater every day because of the many tall buildings
in the cities that are almost always located by rivers,
for to follow these waterways seems to be the birds’
favourite way of travelling.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE USES OF BIRDS</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:0.5em;'><span class='it'>What the Birds do for us</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps even those of you who love birds have never
thought very much about their ways of life. You are so
accustomed to seeing them fly about, and to hearing them
sing, that you do not realize what a strange, unnatural,
silent thing springtime would be if the birds should all
suddenly disappear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, indeed, the world would be sad and lonely without
these beautiful winged voices. But something even more
dreadful would happen should they leave us: the people
of the world would be in danger of starving, because the
birds would not be here to feed on the myriad worms and
insects that eat the wheat and corn and fruits upon which
we, together with other animals, depend for food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The insects gnawing at the roots of the pasture grasses
would destroy both the summer grazing for the cattle
and the hay for winter fodder; if worms destroyed the
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
forests, there would be no trees for firewood, and also the
lack of shade would make the sources of our rivers dry up
and we should soon suffer for water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls and boys might never think of this, but the Wise
Men who live in Washington, and form the association
known as the Biological Survey, as well as those of the
Departments of Agriculture in each state, thought of this
long ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have worked hard and proved the truth of this
whole matter, and now know exactly upon what each
kind of bird feeds; and laws are everywhere being made
to protect the useful birds from people who are either so
stupid or so vicious that they think a bird is something
to be shot or stoned, and that the robbing of nests of eggs
is a clever thing to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any child who stops to think must realize one thing:
As almost all birds live on animal food during the nesting
season, and feed their young with it, and many kinds eat
it all the year, it follows that the more birds we have the
fewer bugs there will be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Also those birds who feed on seeds and wild fruits
destroy in the winter season quantities of weed seeds that
would spring up and choke the crops, while they sow the
seeds of wild fruits and berries, because the pits in these
seeds, being hard, are dropped undigested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But,’ says some one, ‘the Robins and Catbirds came
in our garden and bit the ripe side of the strawberries
and cherries that father was growing for market, and we
had to shoot them to make them stay away.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is all true: some birds will steal a few berries,
but for this mischief they do good all the rest of the long
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
season; so pray ask your father to put only powder, a
‘blank cartridge,’ as it is called, in the gun, that it may
give the birds warning to keep off, but not kill them; and
let him save all the bullets and shot for the Coward
Crow, himself a nest robber, the Great Horned Owl, the
Hen and Chicken Hawks, and the English Sparrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the short stories that I am going to read or tell you
of the birds, I will try to speak of the chief food of each,
so that you may put a good mark beside its name in your
memory, and try to realize that these birds, beautiful as
many are, still have a deeper claim upon you. I wish you
to see that they, as well as you, are citizens of this great
Republic and do their part for the public good, which,
next to the care and love of home, should be the chief
ambition of us all, men or women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wise men know this and they have made laws to
protect the birds and other animals from cruelty and
destruction, just as they have made laws to protect all
other citizens. Listen to what your state forbids you to
do,—to the laws that if you break you must and should
be punished:—</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>WARNING! WHAT THE LAW OF YOUR STATE SAYS ABOUT SONG-BIRDS</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>No person shall kill</span>, catch, or have in possession, living
or dead, at any time, any wild bird other than a game-bird,
nor any part thereof, except the English Sparrow,
Crow, Great Horned Owl, or the Hawks, other than the
Osprey or Fish Hawk. No person shall take, destroy,
or disturb, or have in possession the nest or eggs of any
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
wild bird, and the sale of these birds or shipment out of the
state is forbidden.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Hunting or shooting on Sunday is forbidden.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is <span class='it'>unlawful</span> to kill Fish Hawks, Eagles, Gulls, Terns,
Loons, Divers, Grebes, Doves, Wild Pigeons, Yellowhammers,
Meadowlarks, or Herons at any time. (These
are not game-birds in the reading of the law.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are living in the state of Connecticut, but this is
the substance of the law concerning the taking of eggs or
birds other than game-birds (except when the Wise Men
need them for Museums and have special permission) in
the greater number of states.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tommy Todd, will you kindly go to the coloured map
hanging on the door yonder and point out as I read, those
few states that allow the killing of song-birds. This will
be much easier than for you to learn the names of those
wise states that, like our own, give citizen birds full protection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The east and middle west stand solid for protection,
so you must begin on the Canadian boundary with North
Dakota, then follow Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and
Indian Territory, a bad blot in the centre of the map, but
perhaps some day soon, if all the school children there
learn about the birds, they will beg their fathers and
uncles who go to the legislature to make laws to protect
their birds also. For if they wait until they themselves
grow up, some kinds of birds may have gone forever and
it will be too late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fortunately, you see, there are states next that form
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
a sort of bird bridge of refuge; and then comes New Mexico,
Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, and Montana, without
good laws; but fortunately for the coast birds, Washington,
Oregon, and California are on our side, and it is the duty
of every boy and girl as well as every man and woman
to learn the laws of the state where they live, and keep
them.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CRUELTY TO WILD ANIMALS</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“There are many children of foreign birth who perhaps
would not break the laws of this country if they knew of
them, but do so innocently because they either do not
know, or do not speak English well enough to understand
them fully, and think that in this country, where they
have so much liberty, they are free to do as they like about
everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are also Americans, I am sorry to say, as well as
foreign-born, who have a heartless streak in them, and
first show it by cruelty to helpless, harmless animals.
This should be stopped, as much for their good as future
citizens as for the welfare of the wild animals themselves,
for the child who will kill or torture a dumb beast has the
germs of murder in him that may later, in a fit of passion,
break out toward a fellow-being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of boys—yes, and girls, for I saw
one last spring—who would spend an afternoon in stoning
the hanging nest of an Oriole until the nestlings, dying,
stopped their pitiful cries and fell to the ground in the rags
of their wonderful home, while their parents circled about
in agony? Sad to say, these were American-born children,
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
too, who live not far from Foxes Corners, who very well
knew right from wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When children have this evil mind, the laws of the state
must be used to cleanse,—just as the law may enter the
house and do away with contagious disease. Cruelty is
often as infectious as sickness; and it is, in fact, a sickness
of the mind. It is quite as necessary sometimes that the
heart should go to school and be taught kindness as that
we should learn to read.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>HOW WE CAN PROTECT BIRDS</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“We can help birds simply by not hurting them and leaving
them as free as possible to live out their joyous lives;
but we can do much more if we will leave some little bushy
nooks about the farm or garden, where they may nest in
private, place food in convenient places during the long,
cold winter months for those birds that remain with us,
and <span class='it'>make it a rule never to raise more kittens than we need</span>
to keep barn and house free of rats or than we can feed and
care for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly people, who shirk responsibility, often say, ‘Oh,
I couldn’t think of drowning a kitten,’ and yet they will
let dozens of them grow up unfed and uncared for, or
leave a litter by the roadside, until in many places a breed
of gaunt, half-wild cats roam about destroying the eggs
and young of song-birds, game-birds, and domestic fowls
alike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A nice, comfortable house or barn cat is one thing, but
the savage outcast is quite another, and should no more
be let live than a weasel or a skunk.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>HOUSING AND FEEDING</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“When places become thickly settled, and villages
grow into towns and towns into cities, one of the first
things that troubles the father and mother of a family
is to find house-room, a suitable place to live, that shall be
healthful for the children, and yet not be too far from the
father’s work, and many and many a family have had to
move to inconvenient places because such a home could
not be found near by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange as it may at first seem, our little fellow-citizens,
the birds, have this same trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In an open, half-wooded farming country there are
plenty of nesting haunts, and running brooks and ponds
for the birds who need water by their homestead. But
presently perhaps a railway comes by; the land is bought
up and the woods cut down for railway ties, the brush is
cleared from old pastures and they are turned into house-lots.
Old orchards, like ours here, are done away with,
and everything is ‘cleaned up.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is as it should be, and a sign of progress; but where
are the birds that Nature has told to nest in tree hollows,
like the Bluebird, Chickadee, the Tree Swallow, Downy
and Hairy Woodpecker, and the jolly Yellowhammer,
to find homes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will often hear people say, ‘It is too bad the Bluebirds
are dying out;’ but if somewhere about the place you
will fasten a hollow log or a square bird-box with a single
round opening in it to a high fence-post or to a pole set up
on purpose, you will soon see that the Bluebirds have not
died out, but that they have been discouraged in their
house-hunting.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
“It is a mistake to make bird-houses too large, or to have
many rooms in them, unless you are hoping to attract
Purple Martins, who like to live in colonies. Birds like
a whole building to themselves quite as well as people,
and they do not like people to come too close and peep in
at their windows and doors, either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Autumn and winter are the best seasons for making
and placing bird-boxes; it gives time for them to become
‘weathered’ before nesting time, and birds are apt to be
suspicious of anything that looks too new and fine, and
I have a plan that I think you will like by which you boys
can not only make bird-houses for your own yards and
farms, but make them to sell to others as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is also a kind act for those who live on farms to leave
a few stacks of cornstalks or a sheaf of rye standing in a
fence corner as a shelter for the game-birds, who are often
driven by cold to burrow in the snow for cover, and, frequently,
when the crust freezes above them, die of starvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doing this is wise as well as kind, for it helps to keep
alive and increase these valuable food-birds, and makes
better sport for the farmers in the time when the law
says they may go a-hunting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, in every country school even, there are children
who do not live on farms, but these can club together
and do what they can to feed and shelter the birds that
come about the schoolhouse. You have all seen Goldilocks’
lunch-table for feeding the winter birds, and though Sarah
Barnes would like to have such a one down at the school,
others perhaps may think it foolish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you already know, some birds eat insects and others
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
seed foods, or, to put it another way, some birds prefer
meat and some bread; so if you wish to suit all kinds you
must feed them with sandwiches, made of both bread and
meat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Sandwiches for birds!—how foolish!’ I hear some
one say. Stop and think a moment, and you will see that
it is merely a way of expression, a figure of speech, as
it is called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give the birds the material, crumbs, cracked corn,
hayloft sweepings, bits of fat bacon, suet, or bones that
have some rags of meat attached, and they will make
their own sandwiches, each one to its taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If this food is merely scattered upon the ground, it will
attract mice, rats, and other rodents, but if a regular
lunch-counter is prepared for the food you will find that
the birds will appreciate the courtesy, become liberal
customers, and run up a long bill; this, however, they will
pay with music when spring comes.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A SUGGESTION FOR THE LUNCH-COUNTER</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost every school has a flagpole, and, while some are
fastened to the building itself, like the one at Foxes
Corners, many stand free and are planted in the yard.
However, there is one old tree at your school and I will
ask Jacob to build you a lunch-counter, if you will promise
to see that it is kept well filled with provisions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the way it should be made: Around the pole a
square or circular shelf about eight inches wide can be
fastened, four feet from the ground, and edged with a
strip of beading, barrel hoops, or the like. A dozen
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
tenpenny nails should be driven on the outside edge at
intervals, like the spokes to a wheel, and the whole neatly
painted to match the pole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then each week we will ask Miss Wilde to appoint a
child as <span class='it'>Bird Steward</span>, his or her duties being to collect
the scraps after the noon dinner-hour and place them
neatly on the counter, the crusts and crumbs on the shelf
and the meat to be hung on the spikes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing will come amiss—pine cones, beechnuts,
the shells of hard-boiled eggs broken fine, apple cores,
half-cleaned nuts; and if the children will tell their parents
of the counter, they will often put an extra scrap or so in
the dinner pail to help the feast. Or the fortunate children
whose fathers keep the market, the grocery store,
or the mill, may be able to obtain enough of the wastage
to leave an extra supply on Friday, so that the pensioners
need not go hungry over Sunday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the while the flag will wave gayly above little Citizen
Bird, as under its protection he feeds upon his human
brothers’ bounty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is the story of one of these lunch-counters that
proved a success. It was written to encourage others,
and I will read it so that you may know that bird lunch-counters
belong to real and not to fairy-tales.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AN ADIRONDACK LUNCH-COUNTER</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the Adirondacks in March, 1900, the snow fell over
four feet deep, and wild birds were driven from the deep
woods to seek for food near the habitation of man. It
occurred to me that a lunch-counter with “meals at all
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
hours” might suit the convenience of some of the visitors
to my orchard, so I fixed a plank out in front of the house,
nailed pieces of raw and cooked meat to it, sprinkled bread-crumbs
and seeds around, and awaited results.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first caller was a Chickadee. He tasted the meat,
seemed to enjoy it, and went off for his mate. They did
not seem in the least afraid when I stood on the veranda
and watched them, and after a time paid but little attention
to the noises in the house; but only one would eat at
a time. The other one seemed to keep watch. I set
my camera and secured a picture of one alone. While
focussing for the meat one Chickadee came and commenced
eating in front of the camera, and a second later
its mate perched on my hand as I turned the focussing
screw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw the Chickadees tear off pieces of meat and suet
and hide them in the woodpile. This they did repeatedly,
and later in the day would come back and eat them if the
lunch-counter was empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My observation in this respect is confirmed by a lumber-man,
who noticed that when eating his lunch, back in the
woods, the Chickadees were very friendly and would carry
off scraps of meat and hide them, coming back for more,
time and time again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day another pair of Chickadees and a pair of
White-breasted Nuthatches came. The Nuthatches had
a presumptuous way of taking possession, and came first
one and then both together. The Chickadees flew back
and forth in an impatient manner, but every time they
went near the meat the Nuthatches would fly or hop
toward them, uttering what sounded to me like a nasal,
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
French <span class='it'>no, no, no</span>, and the Chickadees would retire to
await their turn when the Nuthatches were away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of the free lunch must have travelled as rapidly
in the bird world as gossip in a country town usually
does, for before long a beautiful male Hairy Woodpecker
made his appearance, and came regularly night and morning
for a number of days. Hunger made him bold, and
he would allow me to walk to within a few feet of him
when changing plates in the camera. It was interesting
to note his position on the plank. When he was eating,
his tail was braced to steady his body. He did not stand
on his feet, except when I attracted his attention by
tapping on the window, but when eating put his feet out
in front of him in a most peculiar manner. This position
enabled him to draw his head far back and gave more
power to the stroke of his bill, and shows that Woodpeckers
are not adapted for board-walking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, the smaller Downy Woodpeckers were
around; they always are in the orchard toward spring.
I also had a flock of Redpolls come a number of times
after a little bare spot of ground began to show, but,
although they ate seeds I put on the ground, they would
not come up on the lunch-counter and did not stay very
long. Beautiful Pine Grosbeaks came, too, but they
preferred picking up the seeds they found under the
maple trees. The American Goldfinches, in their Quaker
winter dresses, called, but the seeds on some weeds in
the garden just peeping above the snow pleased them better
than a more elaborate lunch, and saying “per-chic-o-ree”
they would leave.—<span class='sc'>F. A. Van Sant</span>, Jay, N.Y., in <span class='it'>Bird
Lore</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
“Now, while you move about and rest yourselves a few
moments, <a id='egret2'></a>I will ask Dave and Tommy to bring that picture
of the great white bird from the easel and place it by the
table here, while I look in this portfolio for another to
put with it. See—here is a bird that is much taller
than the men beside it and wears bunches of plumes on
tail and wings. These two birds represent the wrong
and right side of feather wearing!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are their real names? The Snowy Heron and
the <a id='ost1'></a>Ostrich, both birds of warm climate. I’m always
glad when children wish to know the <span class='it'>real</span> names of birds
and try to remember them. No one can become actually
a friend of a person or an animal whose name is merely
general. Has Miss Wilde ever read you a little poem there
is about the pleasure of learning <span class='it'>real</span> names? No? I
will repeat it and perhaps she will let you learn it next
Friday.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>The White Heron</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps the boys may not be interested in hearing
about feathers and hats,” said Gray Lady, “but the two
birds whose pictures you see here are very interesting in
themselves; and it is well that both boys and girls should
realize all the different reasons why some kinds of birds
have been growing fewer and fewer, until it is necessary
to take active measures for their protection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys have robbed nests and thoughtless men have
shot and caged song-birds, and have often killed many
more food-birds than they could eat, merely for what they
call the ‘sport’ of killing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls who seldom rob nests, unless they are following
the examples of their brothers, and women who would
shrink from touching firearms or killing a bird, will still,
as far as the law allows and sometimes further, wear
birds’ feathers on their hats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not many years ago we often saw whole birds, such as
Humming-birds, Swallows,—like those on Eliza’s hat,—Bluebirds,
and many of the pretty little warblers used
as hat trimming. To-day, this is against the law in all
of the really civilized of the United States, and any
one offering the feathers of these birds for sale may
be arrested and fined.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
“Please, is it any harm to wear roosters’ feathers or
Guinea hens’ and ducks’ wings?” asked Ruth Banks.
“ ’Cause I’ve got two real nice duck wings and a lovely
spangled rooster tail—home-made ducks, you know, that
we hatch under hens,” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it is no harm to use the feathers of domestic
fowls, or other food-birds,” said Gray Lady; “only, unless
we have raised the fowls from which they come ourselves,
it is not easy to be sure about the matter, unless the
feathers are left in their natural colours. They may tell
you in a shop that the wing or breast you see is made of
dyed chicken or pigeon feathers. You must take their
word that this is so, and many times they may have
been misled in the matter themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Birds’ feathers, it cannot be denied, are very beautiful
and ornamental, but to my mind it is very bad taste to
wear anything dead merely for ornament,—furs, of
course, keep the wearer warm as well,—but I myself do
not care for any hat trimming that can only be had by
taking life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is one kind of feather,—the Heron or Egret
plume,—that I am not only sorry, but ashamed, to say is
still in use, because it comes from birds that live in other
countries, and these birds we cannot yet protect. Not
only must these birds be killed to obtain the coveted
plumes, but the killing is done in a brutal way, and at a
time of year—the nesting season—when, according to
the wise law of nature, every bird should be cherished
and its privacy respected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at this great White Heron in the picture beside
me here. He measures two feet from the tip of his bill
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
up over his head to his tail, though you cannot really see
the tail as he is pictured on account of the beautiful
sweeping cloak of fine feathers that cover it. This bird
has yellow eyes and feet, beak and legs partly yellow and
partly black, but is everywhere else white of an almost
dazzling brilliancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many birds wear more beautiful and highly coloured
feathers in the nesting season than at any other. These
Herons, both male and female, are pure white all the year
through, but as the nesting season approaches a change
comes,—a number of slender plumes grow out from
between the shoulders and curve gracefully over the tail,
forming a complete mantle, and it is these feathers that
are sought by the professional plume hunters to be made
into the feathery tufts sold as egrets, though the word
Eliza used by a slip of the tongue, <span class='it'>re</span>grets, I think much
more suitable, for surely any one with a warm woman’s
heart would <span class='it'>regret</span> ever having worn them if she realized
how they are obtained.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Barker gave my mother hers,” put in Eliza,
“ ’cause she’d just found out where they came from and
dassn’t wear it to church ’cause her minister belongs to a
society that wouldn’t like it. She didn’t tell us why,
though; she only said regrets was counted stylish in
N’ York.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Gray Lady, “that is all the idea some people,
who think themselves very clever, have of honour. To
give away a feather that one cannot wear, for fear of what
some one will say, is like giving stolen goods to some one
who does not know that they are stolen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not many years ago this Snowy Heron and his cousin,
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
the American Egret, almost twice his size, might be found
everywhere in the swampy groves of temperate and
tropical America, from New Jersey across to Minnesota
and Oregon, and as far south as Patagonia in South
America. Within a few years I have seen one or two in
autumn in the marshes back of our bay below, for like
many birds they wander about after the nesting season.
Their food consists of small fish,—shrimps, water-beetles,
etc.,—so that they never make their homes far from moist
places. Now, in this country at least, the race is nearly
gone, and it will be only by the strictest laws and most
complete protection that it will be possible for the tribe to
increase. To regain its old footing cannot be hoped for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The beginning of the tragedy came by woman’s love
of finery, and only by her resolutely giving it up can the
trouble be ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Through some happening it was discovered that this
mantle of feathers could be made into ornaments for hats
and hair that were not only widely sought, but brought
a high price. This was enough; bands of hunters were
organized to search the swamps for the Herons and obtain
the plumes <span class='it'>when they were in the best condition</span>. How it
was to be done did not matter, and indeed it has taken the
world many years to realize the horror of it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These Herons breed in colonies. The nest, a stoutly
built, slightly hollowed platform of small sticks, reeds,
etc., is placed either in a tree or tall bush, care being
always taken to keep it safely above the water-line. As
the birds are very sociable, a single bush or tree would
often contain many nests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the nesting season was well under way and the
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
feather cloaks in their first perfection, through the lagoons
and sluggish waterways came noiseless flat-bottomed
boats, low on the water, and poled by the guiding Indian
or half-breed. Astern sat the plume hunters, guns at
rest and eyes eagerly scanning the foliage above their
heads. ‘Ah! here is a rookery at last!’ (rookery being
the name given to colonies of many birds beside the
Rook). The parent birds are sailing gracefully to and
fro, their long legs trailing behind, while they feed the
newly hatched nestlings. For with the most crafty
calculation the plume hunters wait for the time when the
birds are hatched because they know that the parents are
then less likely to take alarm and fly beyond reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boat is stopped by the guide, who grasps an overhanging
branch close to where an opening in the under-brush
gives a good view of the colony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bang! bang! Bodies crashing through the branches
and pitiful cries of alarm mingle for several minutes, as
the confused birds rise, remember their young, and return
to die! When the smoke has lifted, the hunters clear the
ground of the dead and dying and piling them in the boat
begin to tear off that portion of the back, the ‘scalp,’
that holds the precious plumes. If all the birds were dead,
the horror would be less, but time is precious; there are
other rookeries to be visited that day, and so the still
breathing and fluttering birds are also torn and mutilated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the boat glides on, leaving death behind. Yes,
but not the silence that usually goes with death, for there
in a hundred nests are the clamouring hungry broods that
will die slowly of hunger, or be victims of snakes or birds
of prey,—the happier ending of the two.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
“After a day’s work the plume hunters find ground dry
enough for a camp, where they pass the night, and at dawn
they again glide forth on their ghastly errand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes storm, pestilence, and famine may nearly
exterminate a species of bird or beast, but Nature in some
way, if she still needs the type, always manages to restore
and undo her own mischief; but, as a lover of these birds
has said, ‘When man comes, slaughters, and exterminates,
Nature does not restore!’ It is only the men and women
who have done the evil that may be allowed to undo it,
and sometimes it is too late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you see why no one should wear egret plumes,
the feathers of the bird that has been called ‘The Bonnet
Martyr.’ Girls and boys, whoever you may be, who hear
or read this story of the vanishing Snowy Heron, be
courageous, and wherever or whenever you see one of
these regret plumes ask the wearer if she knows how it was
obtained and tell her its story, for whether the bird who
bore it lived in this or another country the manner of
taking is the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There have been foolish stories told of raising these
birds in captivity and gathering the plumes after they are
shed. This is not true. They would, when shed naturally,
be worn and useless, and the egret will always be what one
of the Wise Men has called it, the ‘White Badge of Cruelty.’”</p>

<hr class='tbk100'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Tommy Todd,” said Gray Lady, “you may take
down the Heron and put the other picture in its place.
The bird in it is not graceful and beautiful like the Heron;
in fact, it looks more like some sort of a camel than a bird,
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
but its story is much more cheerful. Its feathers may
be worn by every one, for it is not necessary to kill or hurt
the bird in order to get them. Some of you have guessed
its name already, I am sure.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><a id='ost2'></a><span class='it'>The Ostrich</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Ostriches live in warm countries as well as Herons, but
here the comparison begins and ends, for the Ostrich loves
the open sandy desert and was originally found wild in
Africa, Arabia, and also in Persia. The Ostrich, the largest
bird now alive, is most peculiar both in appearance and
habits. Standing sometimes eight feet in height, it has a
long, almost bare neck, and small stupid-looking head;
its wings are so small that it cannot fly, but its strong legs,
ending in two-toed feet, give it the power of running as
fast as a horse, and it can kick like a horse also, with this
difference,—an Ostrich kicks forward so if you wish to be
perfectly safe you must stand <span class='it'>behind</span> it! At the base of the
wings and tail grow tufts of long and substantial feathers,
the wing tufts being the longer and best. In truth, but for
the fact of the feathers that cover its body, no one would
guess that it was a bird, and even with these it looks
like some strange beast that has put on a borrowed coat
to go, perhaps, to the great Elephant Dance that little
Toomai saw once upon a time in the Jungle, about which
Rudyard Kipling tells so well that sometimes we wake
up in the morning and really believe that we ourselves
have ridden to the dance upon the great Elephant instead
of Toomai.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In wild life birds have always been hunted for their
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
plumage as well as for food. It is thought that the savage
at first killed solely for food, and then used the hides of
beasts and feathers of birds for clothing and decoration
as an afterthought, some of the royal garments of kings
and chiefs of tribes being woven of countless rare feathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When man as we know him, white or civilized man as
he is called, explored wild countries, he introduced two
things that wrought great harm to wild creatures and
savages alike,—the money-trading instinct and strong
drink. In order to buy this drink, which always proved
his ruin, the savage looked about for something to offer
in exchange, and what was there for him but to kill beast
or bird and offer some part of it in trade?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this way the elephants’ tusks, of which ivory is
made, rare furs, alligator hides, and Ostrich eggs and
plumes, as well as rough uncut gems, became known to
the people of Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The savages hunted the wild Ostrich with bow and
arrows that were sometimes poisoned, and the bird being
killed, of course, yielded but one crop of feathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As the Ostrich cannot fly and is a very stupid bird,
living in open deserts where there were few places to hide,
it was very easily destroyed—its only means of escape
being to outrun its pursuers, who were on foot. But
presently when firearms were used to hunt him, the Ostrich
seemed as utterly doomed as the White Heron.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>CLIPPING OSTRICH PLUMES</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“But the day came when men who realized the great
demand there was for these feathers and the profit to be
made by selling them, tried the experiment of raising the
birds in captivity, just as we do our barnyard fowl, treating
them kindly, and feeding them well, so that they might
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
yield not only one but many crops of plumes, because they
knew that the Ostrich is not only long-lived but, like the
smaller birds, changes its feathers every year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Ostrich was a difficult bird to catch and tame
when full grown, for at that time they weigh several
hundred pounds and their habit of kicking has to be
remembered, the same as with a wild horse. So the plan
was tried of collecting the eggs and hatching them out,
and even this was not as easy as it seems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though Ostriches are so foolish that, when chased, they
will often stand still and hide their heads in the sand,
evidently thinking that if they cannot see their pursuers,
they themselves cannot be seen, they make devoted
parents. And this plan was so successful that Ostriches
are now raised like domestic fowls, not only in Africa but
in this country, where the birds were introduced in 1882,
and there are now many successful Ostrich farms in Arizona,
California, and Florida, where alfalfa can be raised
all the year, for this is the best food for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The breeding habits of the Ostrich in captivity are
different from those of the wild birds of the desert who live
half a dozen hens to a family like our barnyard fowls.
The nest is merely a hollow in the sand a foot or so deep,
and several broad, made by the pressure of the great
breast-bone and sides. Eggs are laid, one every other
day, until a ‘clutch’ of a dozen or more has accumulated,
and these must be kept warm for nearly a month and a
half before the chicks will be hatched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you realize that one of these eggs would make
an omelet as large as two dozen and a half hens’ eggs,
and weighs three or four pounds, so that the omelet
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
would feed an entire family, you will understand that it
takes both patience on the part of the parents and a great
deal of heat to hatch these eggs. Sometimes the owners
prefer to hatch the eggs in an incubator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have some of you seen a Robin stand up in the nest
and shuffle her feet; when she does this she is turning
her eggs, and the great Ostrich eggs are also turned every
day. When domesticated, the mother Ostrich tends the
eggs during the daylight hours, but the father takes her
place in the later afternoon and remains until morning.
This is evidently the result of the instinct for colour protection.
The gray female shows the least plainly in daylight
on the sand, while the black-and-white male can
scarcely be seen at night. In fact, the domesticated
bird is a creature of such regular habits that, according
to reliable accounts, the male takes his place on the
nest promptly at 5 <span style='font-size:smaller'>P.M.</span> and does not move until 9 <span style='font-size:smaller'>A.M.</span>
This account does not say whether Mrs. O. lets her
husband have an evening out once in a while to go to his
club or lodge, but perhaps, as he has the rest of the year
to himself, he does not expect a vacation in the important
nesting season. But one thing is known to be true,
that Ostriches are very devoted to each other and that
the pairs when once mated remain together for life, an
attribute of many birds, especially the very long-lived
species. It is said that the wild Ostrich lives to be 100
years old. This may be true, for Ostriches who have been
captives 40 years are still alive and healthy. In the
deserts Ostriches are supposed to be able to go without
water for days at a time, but in captivity they drink
freely every day. This either proves that the habits alter
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
very much, or else, that those who reported their wild
life did not see correctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the young Ostriches are hatched, they are about
the size of a Plymouth Rock hen and are mottled and
fuzzy. They grow very rapidly, so that at nine months
old the bird will be nearly six feet tall, and after this the
plumes are plucked at intervals of nine months; the
feathers do not reach perfection, however, until the third
year, and the birds do not reach maturity and mate until
they are four years old,—and a fine male Ostrich of six
or seven years of age is worth $1000 and will yield from
$50 to $80 worth of feathers yearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When a little over a year old, the mottled plumage that
the young birds wear slowly changes, the female becomes
a dusky gray, and the male glossy black, though they
both grow long white wing-plumes. By this you may learn
that all the gayly coloured plumes that you see are dyed,
and even those that remain black or white go through
many processes of cleansing and curling before they are
sold in the shops.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do they get the feathers off?” asked Sarah
Barnes; “do they wait until they moult or pull ’em like
they do geese?—only that hurts some ’cause the geese
squawk something dreadful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad that you asked that question,” said Gray
Lady, “because it is one of the special points about
Ostrich feathers that should be made known to every one.
If they waited for the feathers to be shed, they would be
worn and broken. You all know how very shabby the
long tail-feathers of a rooster become before the summer
moulting time. When Ostriches were first raised in confinement,
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
their owners used to pluck out the plumes.
But they soon found that not only was this troublesome,
for the pain of it made the birds struggle, but the next
crop of feathers suffered in consequence. Nature has
reasons for everything she plans and there is evidently
some substance in the butt of the old quill that, by keeping
the skin soft and open, prepares the way for the new
one that is to follow and causes it to be of better quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now the plumes are clipped off, and later on the stubs,
which are then dry, come out easily. The feathers of
these birds are much fuller and finer than those that came
from the wild Ostriches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The picture shows an Ostrich in the little three-cornered
pen with the men holding up the tufts and preparing
to snip off the feathers. The pen is made in this
shape so that there will be standing-room for the men,
but not room enough for the Ostrich to turn round and
kick forward. A hood shaped like a stocking is drawn
over his head, and he is perfectly quiet, for he feels no
pain and no blood is drawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you can judge for yourselves that Ostrich feathers
may be safely worn by every one who likes beautiful
things, for certainly there are no feathers so graceful as
a sweeping Ostrich plume with the ends slightly curled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In addition to the fact that the growing and taking of
these feathers is perfectly humane, their use encourages
a large industry which gives employment to many people
here in <span class='it'>our own country</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish my ma had an Ostrich plume in her Sunday
hat instead of that mean egret,” sighed Eliza Clausen,
half to herself. “I can take the smaller wings out of mine
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
and leave the ribbon, but the feather’s the whole topknot
of ma’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Softly as Eliza had spoken, her words could be heard in
the silence that came when the reader closed her scrap-book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo! bravo! little girl,” said Gray Lady, smiling
so brightly that Eliza forgot to be embarrassed. “You
see that your mother was right when she said, ‘When
people get to hearing about birds they stop caring to wear
them in their hats,’ even though she did not mean it quite
in this way. Very few people would wear the cruel
kind of feathers if they only understood. I will give you
a pretty little Ostrich tuft to take to your mother in
exchange for the egret, when you explain to her about it,
and I’m sure Anne can find something among Goldilocks’
boxes to replace your Swallow’s wings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza’s eyes sparkled, and all signs of resentment left
her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” asked Gray Lady, “what will you do with the
poor little wings and the egret? You surely will not give
them to any one else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am, I’ll have a funeral, and bury them down
in the meadow, where my kitten is that fell in the water
barrel and sister’s canary!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then all the children laughed, including Eliza herself,
and Gray Lady joined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“School is over for this afternoon,” said Gray Lady,
“but before you go we must arrange for our next meeting.
I, myself, belong to the Humane Society. How would
you like to organize a little school society of your own to
help one another remember to be kind to everything that
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
lives, and also to see and learn all you can about our
little brothers of the air, whose life and happiness depends
as much upon our mercy as our food and shade, beautiful
flowers, and luscious fruit depend upon their industry?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us call it ‘The Kind Hearts’ Club.’ Who will join
it? Goldilocks and Jacob Hughes are the first two members—how
many more are there here? Oh! Tommy
Todd! one hand is enough to raise, unless you expect to
work for two people!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span><h1>VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE KIND HEARTS’ CLUB</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“While you were playing hide-and-seek in the orchard
this morning, Miss Wilde and I had a long talk about the
Friday afternoons at school,” said Gray Lady, “and what
do you suppose? She has given every other Friday afternoon
to us, to you and to me, not only that we may all
learn about birds and animals and how to be kind to them,
but other things as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be lovely!” exclaimed Sarah Barnes, but
suddenly her face clouded and she added; “that will only
be twice a month, though, and if, when it comes winter,
it’s such bad weather that school has to be closed up of a
Friday, then it would be once a month, and that would be
<span class='it'>very</span> long to wait!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! but you have not heard all of the plan yet,”
said Gray Lady. “Two Fridays of each month I will
go to your school, and two Saturday mornings in every
month you are to come to my house, that is, if you wish to,—of
course you are not <span class='it'>obliged</span> to come. And it will only
be a very bad snow-storm, deeper than horses’ legs are
long, that will keep me away from Foxes Corners, for did
not you and I become friends on a very dreary, rainy
afternoon?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the Friday afternoon at school I will either tell or
read you stories of the birds of the particular season, and
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
I shall give you every chance to ask questions and tell
anything that you have noticed about birds or such little
wild beasts as we have hereabouts, for you know it is a
very one-sided sort of meeting where one person does all
the talking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may be a sober-minded Gray Lady, but I very well
know how tiresome it is to sit still for a couple of hours,
even if one is listening to something interesting. I think
that one can hear so very much better if the fingers are
busy. So, with Ann Hughes’ help, I am going to give the
girls some plain, useful sewing to do, patchwork, gingham
cooking-aprons, and the like. This plain sewing will be
Friday work. On the Saturday mornings that you come
to me you shall have something more interesting to work
upon,—that is, as many of you as prove that they know
a little about handling a needle. You shall learn to dress
dolls and make any number of pretty things besides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t got any thimble,” said little Clara Hinks,
called “Clary” for short, in a quavering voice. “Grandma
is going to give me a real silver one when I’m eight, but
that won’t be until next spring, and now I have to borrow
my big sister Livvie’s when I sew my patchwork, and it’s
too big, and it wiggles, and the needle often goes sideways
into my finger. Besides, she wouldn’t let me bring it to
school, ’cause it’s got her ’nitials inside a heart on one side
of it, and George Parsons gave it to her, an’ anyways she’s
using it all the time, ’cause she’s sewing her weddin’ things
terrible fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady had great difficulty to keep from laughing
outright at this burst of confidence, but she never hurt
any one’s feelings, and her lips merely curved into a quizzical
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
smile, as she said, “What Clara says about her
thimble reminds me to tell you that Ann has a large
work-box with plain thimbles of all sizes, scissors, needles,
and thread. This I used last winter in the city in teaching
some little girls to sew, who were about your ages. I will
lend you these things, and then later on, if you do well,
you will have a chance to earn work-boxes of your own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have we boys got to sew, too?” asked Tommy Todd,
with a very mischievous expression on his freckled face;
“ ’cause I know how to sew buttons on my overalls, and
I can do it tighter’n ma can, so’s they don’t yank off for
ever so long!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I had thought of something quite different for you
boys, though it would not be amiss for you all to know
how to take a few stitches for yourselves, for you are all
liable at some time in your lives to travel in far-away
places, and even when you go down to the shore and camp
out in summer, buttons will come off and stitches rip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seemed to me that hammers and saws and chisels
and nails and jack-knives would be more interesting
to you boys than dolls and patchwork!” As Gray Lady
pronounced the names of the tools slowly, so that she
might watch the effect of her words, she saw five
pairs of eyes sparkle, and when the magic word “jack-knives”
was reached, they were leaning forward so eagerly
that Dave slipped quite off his chair and for a moment
knelt on the floor at Gray Lady’s feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what could we do with all those carpenters’ tools
down at school?” asked Dave, when he had regained his
chair and the laugh at his downfall had subsided. “Dad
says it’s a wonder Foxes Corners’ schoolhouse don’t fall
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
down every time teacher bangs on the desk to call ’tention,—we
couldn’t hammer things up there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that is very true,” said Gray Lady, “but the tools
are to be used at the ‘General’s house’ on Saturdays,
and the jack-knives at school on Fridays! I see that you
cannot guess this part of the plan, so I will not tease you
by making you wait as I had first intended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you may remember, Goldilocks told you this morning
that Jacob Hughes, who now lives with us since he
has left the sea, and keeps everything in repair about
the place, besides being a good carpenter can whittle
almost anything that can be made from wood with a
knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the attic of this house are two large rooms. One of
these Jacob is fitting up for a playroom for my little daughter,
now that she will soon be able to enjoy it. The other
room was the workroom where her father had his tools
and workbench when he was a lad like you, for the General
had him taught the use of all the tools and he used to make
bird-houses and boats and garden seats and even chairs
and such things for the house. He grew to be so skilful
that he learned to carve them beautifully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since he went away to his father and mother in heaven
no one has used the room; but it is not right to let things
be useless when others need them, and now Jacob is putting
that room in order also. Then for half of the time on
Saturday morning he will take you up there, teach you
the use of the tools, and show you how to make bird-houses
and many other things, while on the Friday afternoons,
when the girls are sewing, he will bring some pieces of
soft wood to school, and something that he has carved as
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
a model, and each boy must strive to make the best copy
that he can!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll be bully!” cried Tommy Todd, adding, “and
I think it is just fine of you to let us use those tools that
belonged to—to—” And here Tommy faltered for the
right word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To my husband,” said Gray Lady, very gently, and
the children saw the little mist that veiled her eyes, and
understood better than words could tell them why gray
hair framed the face that was still young and why there
were no gay colours in her dress,—in short, it came to
them why their Gray Lady earned her name, and yet was
never sad nor wished to sadden others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S’pose we haven’t all got jack-knives—that is, ones
that’ll cut?” piped little Jared Hill, blushing red at having
dared to speak. He was the smallest boy in the school
and lived with his grandparents, who, though well-to-do,
evidently believed it sinful to spend money for anything
but food and clothing, for the only Christmas presents
Jared ever had were those from the Sunday-school tree,
and though he was seven years old he had never owned a
knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I lend the girls thimbles and scissors, I must, of
course, lend the boys jack-knives, and give them an equal
chance of earning them for their very own!” And from
that moment Jared Hill firmly believed that angels and
good fairies had fluffy gray hair and wore shimmering
gray garments that smelled of fresh violets, like Gray
Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see,” said she, glancing at a little calendar in a
silver frame that stood upon her desk, “two weeks from
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
to-day will be the 27th; then you come here again. I
should like every boy who can, to bring some bits of old
weathered wood with him. Either a few mossy shingles,
the hollow branch of a tree, a bundle of bark,—anything,
in short, that will make the bird-houses that you build look
natural to the birds, who dislike new boards and fresh
paint so much that they will not use such houses until
they are old and weathered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Gray Lady consulted her calendar. “There
will be eight Saturday meetings before the Christmas
holidays, and we must all be very industrious so as to be
ready for our fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where? what?” cried Sarah Barnes and three or
four other girls together, for to these children on this
remote hillside the word “fair” meant visions of the
County Agricultural Fair, and this stood for the very
gayest of times that they knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little fair of our own to be held in Goldilocks’ playroom
and the workroom where the ‘Kind Hearts’ Club’
will offer its friends bird-houses, dolls, button-bags,
cooking-aprons, and home-made cake and candy. Then,
with the money thus earned, the Club will have a little
fund for its winter work, and each member will, of course,
have a vote as to how the money is to be spent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady opened a small drawer in her desk, and
took from it two packages of picture cards. The picture
on the cards of the first pack was of a little boy releasing
a rabbit that had been caught in a trap. The picture of
the other cards was of a little girl standing in a doorway,
and scattering grain sweepings to the hungry birds on
the snow-covered ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
“Now, who wishes to join the ‘Kind Hearts’ Club’?
We must have some members before we can elect our
officers and begin. The promise you make is very simple.”
On the cards they read only these words: “I promise to
be kind to every living thing.” Under this was a place
to write the name of the member.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can we always tell what it is kind to do? Some
folks think different ways,” asked Eliza Clausen, the hat
feathers still fresh in her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our hearts must tell us that, Eliza,” said Gray Lady,
very gently. “We cannot carry rules about with us, but,
if we have kind hearts always in our breasts, we shall not
make mistakes. And even if our hearts do not feel for
others in the beginning, they may be taught by example,
just as our heads may learn from books. That is what I
wish our Kind Hearts’ Club to stand for—to be a reminder
that there is nothing better to work for in this world than
that our hearts may be kind and true to ourselves, each
other, and to God’s dumb animals that he has given for
our service and has trusted to our mercy, for this is true
worship and doing His will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each one of the children present signed silently and
Gray Lady copied the names in a book, but let the children
keep the cards, both as a reminder and to show their
parents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Wilde came forward at this moment and she and
their hostess explained the manner of electing officers.
Before they trooped out on to the lawn, even then reluctant
to go, Goldilocks had been made president, Miss
Wilde, vice-president, Sarah Barnes, treasurer, and
Tommy Todd, who wrote a very clear, round hand,
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
secretary, Dave, Jared Hill, and the two Shelton boys,
a committee to collect old wood, and Eliza Clausen, Ruth
Banks, and Mary Barnes, a committee to collect odd
patterns for patchwork, something in which the older
country folks showed great ingenuity and took no little
pride.</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh my, do look at the Swallows—there’s hundreds of
them on the wires,” said Tommy, as Goldilocks was
wheeled out on to the front walk to tell the party
“Good-by,” her mother following.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I knew what really truly becomes of them,”
said Sarah Barnes; “father says nobody knows, though
some people say that they go down in pond mud and bury
themselves all winter like frogs, and though you see them
last right by water, I don’t believe it’s likely, do you, Gray
Lady? Though at the end they disappear all of a sudden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not only unlikely, but impossible. I think next
Friday we will begin our real lessons with these fleet-winged
birds of passage that are passing now every day
and night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the good-bys were said again and again, the
children scattered down the road, talking all together,
very much like a twittering flock of Swallows themselves,
and like the birds they were neither still nor silent until
darkness fell. Miss Wilde followed, smiling and happy,
for she had found a friend who not only did not belittle
her work in the hillside school, but showed her undreamed-of
possibilities in it.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span><h1>VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE PROCESSION PASSES</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Time—September 20th. Place—The School at Foxes
Corners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are the stories that Gray Lady told or read from
her scrap-book between September and Flag Day. She
allowed them to be copied at Miss Wilde’s request for the
pleasure of the other children in the township.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><a id='swal1'></a>THE SWALLOWS</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:0.5em;'><span class='it'>Five Swallows and a Changeling</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if there is a child living in the real country
who does not know a Swallow by sight the moment its
eyes rest upon the bird? I think not, and a great many
people who are only in the country at midsummer and in
early autumn also know the Swallows, even though they
cannot tell the different kinds apart, for during the nesting
time, as well as the flocking period that follows, Swallows
are conspicuous birds of the air and leaders of the
birds that might be grouped as “The Fleetwings.” For
not only do Swallows get their food while on the wing, now
pursuing it through the upper air if the day is fair, now
sweeping low over meadow, pond, and river if the clouds
hang heavy and insect life keeps near to the ground, but
during the flocking season, when the separate families
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
join in the community life that they live through the
winter, the Swallows are constantly on the wing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day that we had the orchard party you all noticed
the Swallows flying over the pond between the orchard
and river woods, sometimes alighting so close together on
the bushes as to be as thick as the leaves, and then again
stringing along the telegraph wires, above the highway,
some heading one way and some another until, evidently
at a signal, they flew off again and disappeared in the
distance, until they seemed but a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We agreed, I think, some time ago, that it is much better
to learn the real names of people, animals, and flowers than
to simply give general names. It is more definite to say,
“I saw a Swallow” flying over the moor or meadow, than
to say, “I saw a bird” flying over the meadow; but it would
be more interesting still if we tell the name of the particular
kind of Swallow that was seen, for among the many
kinds that exist at least five are quite common, according
to the part of the United States in which one lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can any of you tell me the names of these Swallows,
how they differ in plumage, and where they live? I can
see by Dave’s face that he knows something about them
and I think Sarah Barnes does also, while as for Tommy
Todd, both hands are up in spite of jack-knife and the
windmill he is making and he can hardly wait for me to
stop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Tommy, how many kinds of Swallows do you
know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three!” he replied promptly. “Barn Swallows, and
<a id='swift1'></a>Chimney Swallows, and Dirt Swallows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard of Barn and Chimney Swallows, but
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
never of a Dirt Swallow. Please describe it to me,”
said Gray Lady, looking interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy hesitated for a minute, for it is one thing to
know a bird by sight, but quite another to carry a correct
picture of it in your mind’s eye and then put it into
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='swalb1'></a>A Dirt Swallow is pretty small and a kind of a dirty
colour on top and a stripe across his chest, the rest white,
and his tail hasn’t sharp points, and he isn’t blue and
shiny like a <a id='barnsw2'></a>Barn Swallow. He doesn’t build a nice nest
like the others, but bores a hole right into a dirt bank,
ever so far in, like a Kingfisher does, just like he was a
ground-hog, and puts feathers in at the end for a nest.
That’s why we call ’em Dirt Swallows. There’s a bank
above Uncle Hill’s gravel-pit that’s full of the holes, and
another bank full right at Farm’s End above the sand
beach where we camped a week last summer. The way
I found out about the holes was by diggin’ down a piece
back of the edge of the bank, for sometimes they bore
as much as four feet. The eggs are real white, not
spotted like Barn Swallows’, ’cause we found a couple of
bad ones, that hadn’t hatched, among the feathers.”
Here Tommy paused for breath, his face all aglow
with eagerness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” said Gray Lady, “is a very good and clear
description of the Bank Swallow, which is the English
name that the Wise Men have given the little bird that you
call the Dirt Swallow. As the bird always burrows its
nesting-hole in a bank and never in field earth or the flat
ground as a woodchuck does, Bank Swallow is decidedly
the better name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
Meanwhile Tommy had glanced hastily out of the
window to where birds were constantly leaving and settling
on the long-distance telephone wires that strung together
the long poles that walked by the door, and up the hillside,
striding across lots where they chose, regardless of
the road. Slipping from his seat to the window, he took a
second look and then said in a harsh whisper, as if afraid
that the birds would hear him and take fright, “Gray
Lady, there’s Bank Swallows mixed in with the Barn
Swallows on the wires, and I’m sure there’s another kind
besides, with a shiny back and all white in the breast.
Wouldn’t you please come out and look? If we go around
the schoolhouse, they won’t notice us from the other side,
but we can see them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady gave a signal and the girls and boys dropped
the sewing and whittling quickly on their desks and,
following her lead, stole out on tiptoe, one after the other,
like the little pickaninnies when they sing, “The bogey
man’ll ketch yer if yer doant watch out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, to be sure, were the Swallows, hundreds of them,
all twittering cheerfully and none of them sitting still
even though they were perching, but pluming themselves,
and stretching their wings, the feathers of which they
seemed to comb with a peculiar backward movement of
one claw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Gray Lady scanned the rows she saw brilliant Barn
Swallows in little groups alternating with the sober-cloaked
Bank Swallows, and then half a dozen each of two other
species that were not so familiar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring me the opera-glasses from the little bag that is
with my hat and gloves,” she said softly to Sarah Barnes.
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
Then, motioning the children to keep still, she crossed the
road to a point where, the sunlight falling behind her, she
could look up at the wires without becoming dazzled, but
as she did so the entire flock left the wires, and wheeling
went down over the corn-field toward the reeds and low
woods that bordered the mill-pond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were quite right, Tommy,” said Gray Lady, as
they still stood looking at the wires in the hope that the
birds might return; “there were not only three but four
kinds of Swallows in that flock. The birds with the
slightly forked tails, beautiful shining steel-blue and
green cloaks, and satiny white underparts are Tree Swallows
that do not nest near here, but stop with us on their
spring and fall journeys, and the others that you did not
notice, because in the distance they look somewhat like
Barn Swallows, except that they lack the forked tail,
are <a id='cliff1'></a>Cliff or Eaves Swallows, as they are called in this part
of the country, where they are rather uncommon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we will go in and I will ask Tommy Todd, who
writes very clearly, to put on the board the names of these
four Swallows, and the particular thing about them that
will help you to tell them apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I am afraid that they are not coming back,” said
Gray Lady, after they had waited a couple of minutes
more, “and they may all leave us suddenly any day now,
though the Barn Swallow often stays into October and the
<a id='whiteb'></a>White-Breasted almost to November.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wagon loaded with rye straw and drawn by a yoke of
oxen came creaking up the hill and paused on the level
place in front of the school. The teamster was Jared
Hill’s grandfather,—the man who did not believe in play
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
or playthings. As his far-sight was rather poor, he did not
notice that the lady with the children was not Miss Wilde.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wal, teacher,” he called, as he leaned against his load,
and tried in vain to discover the object at which the
group was gazing, “what’s up thet there pole, a possum
or a runaway hand-orgin monkey, or mebbe it’s the balloon
got loose from Newbury Fair grounds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, nothing so unusual as that; we have been watching
the flocking of the Swallows,” said Gray Lady, her silvery
voice sounding clearly even in these deaf ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swallers!—out er school watchin’ Swallers?” exclaimed
old Mr. Hill, taking the long straw that he was
chewing from between his teeth in questioning amazement.
“Shucks! what’s Swallers good fer, anyhow? Gee—haw,
Cain! Shish, Abel! We’d best move on; I reckon this
isn’t any place fer folks with something to do!” And thus
addressing his oxen, the load went slowly on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the mischievous twinkle still lingering in her
eyes, Gray Lady asked Tommy Todd to go to the blackboard
as soon as the children settled down to their work
again, and this is what he wrote at Gray Lady’s dictation:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Barn Swallow.</span> You will know it by its glistening steel-blue
and chestnut feathers and <span class='it'>forked tail</span>. Builds mud nests in
barns and outbuildings. Comes in middle April; leaves in September
and early October. Nests all through North America
up to Arctic regions. Winters in tropics as far south as
Brazil.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='tree1'></a><span class='sc'>Tree Swallow.</span> Glistening cloak—<span class='it'>pure white breast</span>. Nests

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
<span class='sc'>Bank Swallow.</span> <span class='it'>Dull brown cloak with band across chest.</span>
Nests in deep horizontal holes in banks. Comes in April; leaves

colonies, they build under the eaves of barns, etc. Nests in
North America to Arctic regions. Winters in the tropics.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Here you have a short description of four Swallows we
have seen this afternoon,” said Gray Lady, as Tommy came
to the end of the board and only finished by squeezing up
the letters. <a id='mart1'></a>“There is another Swallow, the big cousin of
these, called the Purple Martin, with shiny bluish black
cloak and light underparts. This beautiful Martin has a
soft, musical voice, and is very sociable and affectionate,
and even in spring, when the birds have mated, they still
like to live in colonies and are very good neighbours among
themselves. They were once plentiful and nested in tree
holes or houses made purposely for them, but, since the
English Sparrow has come, it has pushed its way into their
homes and turned them out, so now they are rare, and
perhaps you children may never have seen one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was always a high post with a Martin box holding
a couple of dozen families up at ‘the General’s’ as far
back as I first remember, but during our absence no one
watched to keep the Sparrows out, the Martins left, and
the house went to decay. Jacob has made a new house,
and we will not set it up until next Saturday, so that you
can see how it is divided—a room for each family and too
high from the ground for cats to reach. We shall keep the
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
house covered with a cloth all winter, so that the Sparrows
cannot move in before the Martins return, and in this way
we may coax them to come back again and live with us.
Then, who knows, perhaps some one of the Kind Hearts’
Club may have patience and take the trouble to build a
house and then <a id='mart2'></a>Purple Martins may become plentiful
in Fair Meadow township.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You heard what Farmer Hill asked a few minutes ago,—‘What’s
Swallers good fer, anyhow?’ I want you all
to be able to answer this question whenever you hear it
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the first place Swallows do no manner of harm;
they neither eat fruits nor useful berries, nor do they
disturb the nests and eggs of other birds. They are
beautiful objects in the air, and their laughing twitter
when on the wing is a sound that we should miss as much
as many real bird songs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘These are pleasant qualities,’ some may say, ‘but
not exactly useful.’ Listen! As these Swallows are
Fleetwings and always birds of the air, so they are sky sweepers,
living upon flying insects that few other birds
may take, and the large amount of these that they consume
is almost beyond belief; so watch when they come
back next spring on their return as they fly over the cattle
in the pasture, or over the pond surface teeming with
insect life. If they do nothing else, they earn their living
one and all by <span class='it'>mosquito-killing</span>, and the Wise Men of to-day
know that the sting of one sort of mosquito is not merely
an annoyance, but that it pushes the germ of malaria and
other bad diseases straight into the blood.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i127.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0008' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>THE PURPLE MARTIN</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Not only are Swallows harmless and useful in the
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
places where they nest, but are equally useful in all
their journeyings through the south. Some birds, like
the Bobolink, are both useful and harmless where they
nest, but do harm as they travel, for when the Bobolink
leaves for the south he goes into the rice-fields, eating the
rice grains in late summer and plucking up the young
rice in the spring. This, of course, gives him a bad name in
the rice-growing regions through which he passes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the Swallow only destroys the evil insects as it
journeys through the south, and yet in spite of this, cruel,
or at best thoughtless, people kill them for the mere sport
of killing, for no white man could pretend to eat Swallow
pie, and the great flocks are tempting marks for ‘sportsmen’
of this class. Then, too, the noise made at the places
where these birds roost, especially the Martins, has served
as an excuse for shooting them in numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the people in the southern states would only fully
understand that Swallows destroy the boll-weevil that
damages the cotton in the pod, they surely would not allow
a feather of these little workers to be injured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How I wish we could have a Kind Hearts’ Club in every
district school in the south, so that the children there
might help us to protect the birds during the time that they
are beyond our reach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady paused and turned the leaves of her scrap-book,
as if she was searching for something. “Ah!
here it is!” she said at last, half to herself. “The Wise
Men at Washington who find out for us all the facts
about the useful birds have been writing about these
Swallows, and say that everything should be done not only
to protect them but in every way to aid their increase by
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
providing homes for them. Let us hear what more they
say about these five that I have just described to you.”</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><a id='tree2'></a><span class='sc'>Tree Swallow.</span> The Tree Swallow, as is well known, has been
persecuted by the English Sparrow until it has entirely abandoned
many districts where formerly it abounded. An energetic war
on the English Sparrow, and the careful protection of the Swallow
domiciles, in a few years would result in a complete change of
the situation, so far as this, one of the most beneficial of the
Swallow tribe, is concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='barnsw3'></a><span class='sc'>Barn Swallow.</span> The Barn Swallow formerly was abundant
throughout the northern states, especially in New England.
The tightly built modern barn, however, no longer invites the
presence of the Barn Swallow by affording it friendly shelter,
and the birds are becoming scarcer and scarcer. To provide
openings in modern barns, and to encourage the presence in them
of colonies by providing convenient nesting sites are easy and
effective methods by which this beautiful species may be greatly
increased in numbers. This bird also requires protection from
the English Sparrow, which in one foray has been known to kill
the young and destroy the eggs of a large colony.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='swalb2'></a><span class='sc'>Bank Swallow.</span> The well known Bank Swallow, as its name
implies, nests in sand-banks in holes of its own digging. Some
farmers in the northern states take special pains to protect their
colonies of Bank Swallows from the marauding of the prowling
cat. Some even take pains to excavate suitable banks on their
farms and devote them to the exclusive use of the Swallows.
Gravel and sand-banks are so numerous throughout the north,
especially in New England, that at trifling expense the number
of colonies of Bank Swallows may be vastly increased, to the
advantage of every farmer north and south, and to that of every
nature lover as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='cliff3'></a><span class='sc'>Cliff Swallow.</span> The curious pouch-shaped mud structures
of the Cliff Swallow, attached under eaves or to the face of cliffs,
are a sight familiar enough in the northern and western states,
but in the cotton states, save Texas alone, they are wanting,
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
the bird that makes them being exclusively a migrant. The
English Sparrow persecutes also the Cliff Swallow; hence, in the
north, the bird is much less common than formerly. In Germany
the presence of Swallows around houses is so much desired that
artificial nests made of clay or other material are put up in
order to attract birds by saving them the labour of constructing
their own domiciles. No doubt our own Cliff Swallows would
be quick to respond to a similar offer of ready-made dwellings,
rent free, and in this way the range of this extremely useful
species might be materially increased. The Cliff Swallow is one
of the most indefatigable insect destroyers extant, and every
motive of patriotism and humanity should prompt communities
among which they live to protect and foster them in every possible
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Purple Martin.</span> <a id='mart3'></a>This, the largest and in many respects the
most beautiful of all our Swallow tribe, is the most local and the
least numerous. In New England and, perhaps, in most of the
northern states generally, this fine bird is steadily diminishing
in numbers. The English Sparrow often takes possession of its
boxes, ruthlessly kills the young Martins or throws out the eggs,
and usually succeeds in routing the colony and appropriating the
boxes. When measures are not taken to abate the Sparrow
nuisance in the immediate vicinity of Martin colonies, the usual
result is that the Martins are forced to abandon their houses.
The habit of putting up houses for the accommodation of Martin
colonies is not as common in the north as it formerly was, and
to this indifference to the Martins’ presence, to persecution by
the Sparrow, and to losses due to the prevalence of cold storms
during the nesting season, no doubt, is due the present scarcity
of the bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the standpoint of the farmer and the fruit grower, perhaps,
no birds more useful than the Swallows exist. They have
been described as the light cavalry of the avian army. Specially
adapted for flight and unexcelled in aërial evolutions, they have
few rivals in the art of capturing insects in mid-air. They eat
nothing of value to man except a few predaceous wasps and
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
bugs, and, in return for their services in destroying vast numbers
of noxious insects, ask only for harbourage and protection. It is
to the fact that they capture their prey on the wing that their
peculiar value to the cotton grower is due. Orioles do royal
service in catching weevils on the bolls; and Blackbirds, Wrens,
Flycatchers, and others contribute to the good work; but when
Swallows are migrating over the cotton-fields they find the
weevils flying in the open and wage active war against them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>—<span class='sc'>H. W. Henshaw</span>, B.B.S., in <span class='it'>Value of Swallows as Insect Destroyers</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“That Wise Man didn’t say anything about Chimney
Swallows, and, please, Gray Lady, you left them out, too,”
said Sarah Barnes, the moment the scrap-book closed,
“and I know they catch lots of flying bugs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Sarah!” exclaimed Gray Lady, laughing, “I did
not precisely forget, but I was waiting for some one of you
to ask the question. The bird that is called the Chimney
Swallow even exceeds the others in being forever on the
wing and never perching or ‘sitting down,’ as Sarah calls
it, and it is a brave insect destroyer. In fact, it never
perches even for one moment, but when it does rest makes
a sort of bracket of its sharply pointed tail-feathers and
rests against a tree or inside the chimney, somewhat as a
Woodpecker does when resting on an upright tree-trunk.
The Woodpeckers, however, have very strong feet, and the
feet of the Chimney Swallow are very weak. But here
comes the funny part—this chimney bird isn’t a Swallow,
and the Swallows would call him a changeling. He is a
Swift, first cousin to the tiny Humming-bird and the
mysterious Night Hawk and Whip-poor-Will, so we must
leave his story until we come to that of the family where
he belongs, for after we have learned the names of individual
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
birds, it is well to know their family and kin. You
cannot always tell by the plumage of birds if they are
related. Louise Stone, Fannie White, and Esther Gray
here are cousins, and all live in one house, but as their last
names are different, and they do not look alike, a stranger
would have to be told, for he could not guess that they
belong to one household.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is three o’clock already, and I see that Tommy and
Dave have quite finished their windmills and Ruth’s
apron is waiting for the pocket, so in spite of Farmer
Hill’s remarks about ‘not working,’ every one has
something to show for this Friday afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before we go, let me see if you can tell the ‘<span class='it'>Things
to remember</span>’ about the five swallows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sarah—the <a id='barnsw4'></a>Barn Swallow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shiny, steel-blue back and forked tail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dave—the <a id='swalb3'></a>Bank Swallow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dusty cloak fastened across the front.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruth—the <a id='tree3'></a>Tree Swallow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“White satin breast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roger—the Eaves Swallow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“White on its forehead and all over mixed colours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='mart4'></a>And the Purple Martin? Who knows it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the biggest of all and doesn’t fly quite so sudden.
I’ve seen ’em up at Grandpa Miles’s in New York State,”
said little Clary Hinks, and then blushing because she had
dared to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next week in the playroom!” said Gray Lady, smiling
over her shoulder at them as they filed out the door to the
time beaten by Tommy’s drum.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span><h1>IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>TWO BIRDS THAT CAME BACK</span></h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>(<span class='sc'>Birdland</span>, September 27th.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rain had poured steadily all Thursday and Friday,
until Friday evening, and the wind blew so hard that
many a little window-pane in the older farm-houses fell
in with a crash and the owner, jumping up quickly to
snatch the lamp out of the draught, would exclaim,
“I do declare, we haven’t hed sech a genuine old-fashioned
line-storm for years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “line” being the short for equinox, the imaginary
line crossing the sun’s path over which, on March 21st,
old Sol is supposed to step from winter into spring.
Again, on September 21st, he steps from summer into
autumn, takes off his summer hat, with its crown of burning
rays, and tells his wife to ask North Star for the key to
the iceberg, where his winter flannels are kept in cold
storage, so that they may be ready for any emergency.
The fact that these storms seldom come upon the days
when they are due, simply proves that the solar system
prefers to measure time to suit itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little before dawn, on Saturday morning, the rain
stopped; the heavy clouds in the east broke up into bars
of blue steel, through which the sun peered cautiously,
as if uncertain whether or not to break them away. Then,
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
suddenly deciding that it would, it signalled to the clear,
cool, northwest wind to blow and chase away the vapours
that made the clouds too heavy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time Tommy Todd’s father came in, carrying
two milk-pails, Tommy following with a third, there was
promise of a fine crisp autumn day, and Grandpa Todd,
who had decided a week before, on his eightieth birthday,
that he would give up milking, at least for the winter,
came into the well-porch, and scanning the sky carefully,
with an air of authority, said: “To-night we’ll have hard
frost if the wind drops. We’d better get in those cheese
pumpkins jest as soon’s they’re dried off. Robins and
Blackbirds flockin’ powerful strong, and old Chief Crow
has brung his flock clear down to the ten-acre lot already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Chief was the name that Grandpa Todd had given
to a particularly wise bird, whom he insisted was twenty-five
years old at the least, who was master of the roost in
the cedar woods and, by his wise guidance, kept his flock
the largest in the township, in spite of all the efforts of
the farmers, hired men, and boys in the vicinity to drive
them out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, also, on the slope south of the house, were fully
half a hundred Robins pluming themselves, shaking their
feathers out to dry, and acting in every way like travellers
pausing on a journey, rather than residents going out for a
stroll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy had paused to look at them, balancing the pail
carefully as he did so, and then the sight of the birds reminded
him that it was the day to go up to “the General’s,”
and he hurried in to eat his breakfast and finish the
Saturday morning “chores” that he always did for his
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
mother. Then he went to the shed to look over the collection
of bits of old wood that he had both begged and
gathered far and near for the making of bird-houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A neighbour, who was re-covering his cowshed roof with
galvanized iron, had let Tommy pick up as many mossy
shingles as he could carry, and some of these were really
beautiful with tufts of gray lichens, some with bright red
tips, blending with mosses of many soft shades of green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy selected from the assortment as large a bundle
as he could carry, and, after cording it securely, went to
the house to tidy up, for Gray Lady had asked the children
of the Kind Hearts’ Club to come at nine o’clock this
first Saturday, for it would take them some time to look
at the play and work rooms before settling down to doll-dressing
and bird-house making. As he crossed the
kitchen, his mother, who was kneading bread, pointed a
floury finger toward a garment that hung over the back
of a chair. Tommy picked it up, and then his usual boyish
indifference, which he kept up at home even when he
was pleased, broke down and he gave an exclamation of
delight, for there was a new carpenter’s apron with a
pocket for nails in front, the whole being made of substantial
blue jean, precisely like the one worn by Jacob
Hughes himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady had asked as many of the boys as owned
overalls to bring them. Tommy’s were very old and had
many patches, besides being smeared with paint, and he
hated to have dainty Goldilocks see them, so it seemed to
the boy that his mother must have seen straight into his
mind (as mothers have a way of doing) and read what
he most needed.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
Slipping his head through the yoke and fastening the
waist-band in place, Tommy suddenly grabbed his mother,
flour, bread, and all, in a rough embrace, and then clattered
up the backstairs, laughing at the two white hand-marks
that she had printed on his shoulder in her surprise.</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>Up at “the General’s” house Gray Lady, Goldilocks,
Ann, and Jacob Hughes were as busy as possible making
preparations for the first regular meeting of the Club.
To the children, the whole performance in anticipation
seemed like the most delightful sort of play, but every
one who thinks will realize how much pains Gray Lady
was taking to have everything in order for the children’s
first view of the place. After this, like the wise friend
that she was, she had planned that the children themselves
would in turn take out the work, put it away, and
clear up threads or shavings as the case might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The playroom was on the southeast corner of the attic,
and had three dormer-windows with wide seats underneath.
Being an attic, the windows were set rather high
in the slanting room, but, if one stood on the wooden seats,
there was a beautiful view toward the river valley on the
south, while the east window looked down over the orchard,
and it seemed as if one might almost step out and
walk upon the tree-tops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the chimney side was a small-sized cooking-stove,
and between this and the chimney-corner ran shelves with a
cupboard beneath, whereon and in a set of blue-and-white
dishes and various pots and pans were ranged. At either
end of the room was a stout table surrounded by chairs, one
being a kitchen table with a drawer, and the other a plain
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
dining table with a polished top, suitable for playing
games, or holding books or work. It was upon this table
that the work-boxes and dolls were ranged, twelve in all,
and by each a little pile of clothes, all cut and ready-basted,
the whole being covered by a cloth. Gray Lady and
Ann had agreed between themselves that lessons in sewing
had better come first and garment-cutting follow later on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the garments were to be made to put on and take
off like real clothes, and though they were very simple,
each doll when dressed would personate a different character,
for there was clothing for a baby doll, a schoolgirl,
a young lady, a trained nurse, little Red Riding-Hood, and
so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The workshop faced north and east, and was on the
opposite side of the stairs. This was of the same shape
as the playroom, but a small wood-stove, that could be
used for heating glue-pots, and to keep the room from
freezing in winter, took the place of the cooking-stove,
and there was a long workbench, with vise, lathe, and
mitre-box attachment under two of the windows where
the best light fell. Across one side of the room, various
tools were hung in racks, while at the end opposite the
windows was tacked a great sheet of paper upon which
many styles of bird homes were pictured. Below this
was a space painted black like a school blackboard, and
upon this Jacob had redrawn in rough chalk several
of the pictures to a working-scale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady and Goldilocks were already upstairs when
the party arrived, for though Goldilocks could walk very
nicely when on a level, going up and down stairs was a
matter that took time.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
Tramp, tramp, came the feet up the stairs to the second
hall, with the rhythm of a marching regiment. Then
there was a pause and evidently some discussion, for, as
Gray Lady went forward and opened the door at the
head of the attic stairs, she heard Sarah Barnes’ voice
say, “Why, it’s a big Crow and a little one; but how
did they come in here? Don’t touch him, Tommy, he’ll
bite you. Crows bite like everything when they get
mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Tommy’s voice said, <a id='crow3'></a>“The big one’s a Crow, sure
enough, but the little one couldn’t be any more’n mice’s
little rats. It’s one of those queer new birds that had
nests down in the Methodist Church steeple last spring;
I went up with Eb Holcomb one day when he was fixing
the bell-rope and I saw them, but nobody ’round here
knows what they’re called—unless Gray Lady may.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking down, Gray Lady saw the odd pair in question
and said to Goldilocks, “Your two pets have managed to
get in and are trapped between the top and bottom of
the stairs. Whistle for them, dearie, for the children are
waiting to come up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goldilocks gave two very good imitations of the quavering
call of a Crow, and then, using a little oddly shaped
silver whistle that hung about her neck on a ribbon, gave
a series of melodious whistles, when, to the surprise and
delight of the children below, Crow and Starling (for this
was the name of the smaller bird) immediately turned
about and went upstairs, the Crow hopping and flopping,
for one of its wings was deformed, and the Starling, as
soon as it had room enough for a start, flying straight and
true. When the children followed, they found the Crow
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
perched on the back of Goldilocks’ chair and the Starling
flitting about the open rafters until he found a perch that
suited him upon a hook that had once held a hammock,
where he seemed quite at home. The Crow, however,
was anxious and uneasy when he saw the children trooping
up, and flopping from the chair-bar with a sidewise motion,
he scuttled across to the stove, under which he disappeared,
occasionally peering out with his head on one side
like a very inquisitive human being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t wonder that you look astonished,” said Gray
Lady, “at seeing birds in this house that are apparently
captive, but the truth is that they will not go away, and
come back through every open window. So, as we have
not the heart to drive them away, we let them live here
in the playroom and about the barns, where they find
plenty to eat, and at any moment they wish to go, freedom
is close at hand for the taking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what made them come to begin with?” asked
Dave. “Crows are mostly the scariest things going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jacob found the Crow up in the cedar woods in May,”
said Goldilocks. “All the others were able to fly and take
care of themselves, but this one stayed in the low bushes
and its parents were feeding it. One morning, when
Jacob was up there cutting cedar posts for the gate he
made to Birdland, he heard a great commotion; the old
Crows and the young ones were cawing and screaming and
flying about in distress, while crouching in the bushes,
and just ready to spring upon the Crow, was a big half-wild
cat. It used to belong to the people up at the lumber
camp, but when they went away they left it, and all last
winter and spring it has lived by hunting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
“I know about that cat,” said Tommy. “The Selectmen
have offered five dollars’ reward for it, and it kills
more chickens, even big roosters, than all the Hawks
this side of Bald Hill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After Jacob had driven the cat away,” continued
Goldilocks, “he picked up the young Crow to try to find
out why it had not flown away like its brothers. At first
it was afraid and fought and pecked his fingers, but by
and by it let him handle it, and he found that one wing
was twisted, so that it was of no use. The point where
the long quill feathers grow was turned under, Jake said,
just the way it is in a roast chicken, and it must have
happened when the bird was little and had no feathers,
because those on that point of the wing were stunted and
twisted where they had tried to grow after it was hurt.
Jake straightened the wing as well as he could, and
clipped the feathers on the other one so that he shouldn’t
be so lopsided. The wing is stiff and doesn’t work rightly
yet, but Jake thinks that after next summer’s moult the
feathers may come in better; meanwhile I’ve called him
Jim, because that is the usual name for tame crows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jim likes to live about here and he does such a lot of
funny things. Why, the other day, out in the arbour,
he dropped the little afternoon-tea sugar-tongs into the
cream jug and took all the lumps of sugar in the bowl and
hid them in the empty robin’s nest overhead, and we
should never have dreamed that he had done it if Anne
hadn’t come in with fresh cakes and startled him so that
he dropped the last lump. He moves very quickly, for
he can fly a little and he uses his wings and beak to help
him climb, something like a parrot. Jacob has put him
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
over in the woods by the Crow’s roost, time and time
again, but he always comes hopping back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sarah Barnes was going to ask what else the Crow had
done, when the <a id='star'></a>Starling flew across the room and out
through one of the windows that was opened from the top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s gone!” she cried; “I’m dreadfully sorry, ’cause I
wanted to look at him so’s I’d know Starlings if I see them
again. Please, how did you get him? His wings seem
very strong, and he flew as straight as anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Larry has only gone out for a little fly,” laughed
Goldilocks; “he will be back before long, and if the window
should happen to be closed, he will rap on the glass
with his beak. No, his wings are well and strong, and
he is perfectly able to go away to his friends in the
church tower, for it was from one of those nests, that
Tommy saw up between the slats, that he fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eben brought him up for mother to see, because a good
many people down at the Centre Village had been watching
these strange birds, and wanted to know their name and
where they came from. He was too little to be turned out
all alone, and Eben said that the nest had been upset and
the others that fell out were dead, so, as he ate soaked dog-biscuit
(because you know that there’s meat in it that
makes up for bugs to young birds), I thought I would bring
him up and then let him go; but you see the joke is that he
won’t go, and he acts as much afraid of being out-of-doors
after dark as a usual wild bird would if you put him in a
cage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who brought Starlings here, and do they belong to
the same family as Blackbirds? They look a lot like them,
only they’ve got shorter tails,” said Tommy Todd.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
“I think I have a description of the bird, as well as the
date of his coming, in the scrap-book,” said Gray Lady,
“for he is an English bird and the only one of its family
in this country, so you can see why they may be lonely,
and like to flock in company with the Blackbirds.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:0.5em;'><span class='sc'>The Common Starling</span>: <span class='it'>Sturnus magnus</span>.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Length</span>: 8.5 inches.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Male and Female</span>: Black plumage shot with metallic green and
blue lights. In full plumage upper feathers edged with
buff, giving a speckled appearance, which disappears as
the feathers are worn down, leaving the winter plumage
plain and dull. Yellow bill in summer; in winter, brown.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Note</span>: A sharp flock-call and a clear, rather musical, two-syllable,
falling whistle.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Nest</span>: Behind blinds in unoccupied buildings, in vine-covered
nooks in church towers; also in bushes.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Eggs</span>: 4-7, greenish blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This bird is a foreigner, imported to New York City some fourteen
years ago, some people are beginning to fear not too wisely,
for the birds are rather quarrelsome, and, being larger than
the English Sparrow, though not so hardy, are able to wage war
upon birds like Robins, and seize the nesting-places of natives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first birds, less than a hundred in number, were set free
in Central Park, New York City. Now these have increased to
numerous flocks that in Connecticut have gone as far east as
New Haven, and here in Fairfield and several villages near by
are acclimated and quite at home, though the bitter and lasting
cold of the winter of 1903-1904 thinned them out considerably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether they prove a nuisance or not, they are very noticeable
birds, looking to the first sight, as they walk sedately across a
field, like Grackles with rumpled plumage. A second glance will
show that this is but the effect of the buff specks that tip all the
upper feathers, while the distinct yellow bill at once spells
Starling!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
In England they may be seen on the great open plains following
the sheep as they feed, very much as the Cowbird follows our
cattle, and in that country are very beneficial as insect destroyers.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“They are birds that will feed at the lunch-counter in
winter, for their food supply is cut off by snow, and, as
strangers, they have not yet the resources of the Crows
and Jays, neither are they as hardy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boys, Jacob is ready for you in the workroom, and
he may keep you till quarter-past ten. I do not think
that you will really accomplish much to-day, except to
choose the kind of house you wish to make, and plan out
your work. Then you may all take a fifteen-minutes’
recess in the orchard before you come up for the bird
lesson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What birds are you going to tell about to-day? I
hope that they won’t be hat birds and Martyrs,” said
Eliza Clausen, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not ‘hat birds’ this morning, although there are
plenty more of them, and always will be so long as people
insist upon wearing the feathers in their hats. I had
not quite decided what birds to take up next, but the recess
in the orchard gives me a new idea. Instead of
taking the birds in any set order, when you come in you
shall tell me what birds you have noticed this morning.
By this means we shall be able to take the birds as they
come with the seasons, and they will never grow tiresome.
Then, too, if, between times, you see any birds that you
cannot name, or about which you wish to know, remember
to tell me, and we will try to learn something about the
bird while it is fresh in your memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” as the boys went to the workroom, “the girl
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
members of the Kind Hearts’ Club will please thread
needles and begin. If any one of you has sticky fingers,
Ann will show you where to wash them, because the very
beginning of good sewing lies in clean hands, for they mean
nice white thread and bright, shining needles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the cover was lifted from the table, and the girls
saw the dolls, and the little stack of clothes, they exclaimed
in delight,—even those like Katie Lee, who really
did not belong at school, for she had stopped playing
with dolls and was ready for the eighth grade. Only,
unfortunately, there was no eighth grade class at Foxes
Corners, and as it was too far for them to walk to the Centre
every day, they stayed on at school, and Miss Wilde
helped them as far as her time allowed so that they might
make up the required lessons at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children came back very promptly after the mid-morning
recess, considering the attraction offered outside.
Though cheeks and all available pockets fairly bulged with
apples, they had sufficient appetite to enjoy the crisp
cookies, plates of which were set at intervals on the plain-topped
table in the playroom, together with pitchers of
milk or a delicious drink of Ann’s invention compounded
of oranges and lemons and sweetened with honey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady breakfasted at eight, but she knew very
well that most of the folk of the Hill Country had their
first meal at six, except perhaps in the dead of winter, so
that a bit of luncheon between that time and noon was
what Goldilocks called “a comfy necessity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now tell me what birds you saw this morning, and
what they were doing,” said Gray Lady, as soon as the
children had settled down. “Sarah Barnes, you may
begin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We didn’t see anything new, that is nothing much;
but, oh, such a lot of common birds in flocks, <a id='crow4'></a>Crows and
Blue Jays and Blackbirds; why, there were enough Blackbirds
to make it dark for a minute when they picked up
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
and flew over the tumble-down old house over there in
the corner. Of course, those birds aren’t very interesting,
’cause we all know about them, and I guess even Zella,
who hasn’t lived here long, can tell a Crow or a Jay and
Blackbird when she sees one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am, Lady, I know him Crow,” cried Zella, in
delight at having some information to impart, “for my
papa he plant corn seed in the lot. Crows they come push
it out vit de nose and eat him. Then my papa and my
brudder shoot bang! bang! but they not get him, ’cause
him too wise. My Grossmutter say von time Crows was
people, bad thief people, and they was made in birds to
shame dem, but dey made bad thief birds, too, and dey
kept wise like dey was people yet, so dey is hard catching.
Den papa he made of ole clothes a man, and sat him the
fence on, and the Crows dey comes on trees near away,
and dey looks so at the mans and dey laughs together, but
dey not come no more very near yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I see that Zella knows and sees the Crow as almost
every one who owns a bit of land sees and knows him, but
there are sides to these birds that are so common hereabouts
that perhaps you do not know, for I did not at your
age, and it is only of late years that the wise men have
been trying to find good points in some birds that have
been always called bad. What they have discovered goes
to prove what an unfortunate thing it is for any one, bird
or person, to get a bad name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Grandma says a bad name sticks just like fly-paper,”
said Ruth Barnes, eagerly, “ ’cause even if you can
peel it off you, it always somehow feels as if it was there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this every one laughed, because almost every child at
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
one time or another had been through some sort of an
experience with sticky fly-paper, and little Bobbie chuckled
so long that Gray Lady asked him what he knew about fly-paper,
and thus drew forth the explanation that his
father had sat on a sheet of fly-paper in the dark best
parlor one Sunday morning when he was waiting for the
family to get ready to drive to church, and nobody noticed
until he, being a deacon, got up <span class='it'>to pass the plate</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were the Crows and Jays and Blackbirds in
the orchard doing, Tommy; did you notice?” asked Gray
Lady, as she arranged some papers between the leaves of
her scrap-book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='jay2'></a>The Jays were hanging around your lunch-counter in
the old apple tree, that is, most of them; some seemed to be
bringing acorns or some sort of big seeds from the river-woods
way, and taking them into the attic of the old
Swallow Chimney house. I never saw so many Jays at
once; I counted sixteen of them,” said Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Crows and Grackles were walking on the ground,
some in the grass meadow, and some in the open ploughed
field, and they were all searching about as if they had lost
something, and they kept picking and eating all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were they eating corn that had dropped, or rye?”
asked Gray Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, there wasn’t any corn there, and the rye isn’t
sown yet. They were eating bugs and things like that,
I guess,” said Tommy, to whom a new idea had come as he
spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is precisely what I hoped that one of you would
see for yourself—the fact that both of these birds eat
many things besides corn and grain.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
“By the way, what kind of Blackbirds were they?—for
we have three sorts that are very common here. The Red-winged,
those with red shoulders that come in such numbers
about the swampy meadows early in spring. The
Cowbird of the pastures who is smaller than the Red-wing,
with a brown head, neck, and breast, the rest of him being
gloomy black, with what Goldilocks calls all the ‘soap-bubble
colours’ glistening over it, though the Wise Men
call this ‘iridescence.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='grack1'></a>Then there is the Crow-Blackbird or Purple Grackle,
the largest of the three, who is quite a foot in length from
tail-tip to point of beak. This Blackbird has glistening
jet feathers, with all the beautiful rainbow colours on his
back and wings, that almost form bars of metallic hue,
and he is a really beautiful bird that we should certainly
appreciate better if it were not so common. Now, of
course, it is one step on the way to bird knowledge if you
can say surely this is a Blackbird, but it is necessary to go
on then and say <span class='it'>which</span> Blackbird.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were the Purple Grackle kind,” said Tommy,
immediately, “for they were bigger than Cowbirds, and
they had handsome shiny feathers, and they did just creak
and grackle like everything while they walked around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good,” said Gray Lady; “now I think that there
are several things that you do not know about these birds,
whom it is perfectly safe to call ‘mischief-makers’ and
undesirable garden friends, though our best knowledge
will not allow us to condemn them altogether as criminals,
as was once the custom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment Jim Crow, who had been on an excursion
first to the room, then, by way of the branches of an
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
overhanging sugar-maple, quite down to the orchard lunch-counter
and back, had crept in at the window unobserved,
walked across the floor to the work-table, about which the
girls sat, and, going under it, was concealed by the cloth.
At this moment Eliza Clausen dropped her thimble. It
rolled under the table, and as she stooped to get it she
was just in time to see Jim seize it in his beak and half fly,
half scramble to the back of Goldilocks’ chair, with his
prize held fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my thimble! Jim’ll swallow it!” she wailed, and
the boys, with one impulse, started in pursuit. They could
not have done a worse thing, for, seeing himself cornered,
Jim’s hiding instinct came to his aid, and sidling along to
the unceiled side of the attic, he quickly dropped the
thimble between the studs, and you could hear it rattle
down to the next story. Then he took refuge behind his
mistress’ chair, from which he peeped inquisitively, with
the sidewise look peculiar to Crows, so that it was impossible
not to laugh at his quizzical expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not worry about the thimble, Eliza,” said Gray
Lady, “for those you are wearing for the sewing lessons
are not prize thimbles, but merely penny affairs. This
gives you a chance to see some of the little bits of mischief
that a tame young Crow can do in his first season, so that
you can imagine what a wild, old, wise, leader Crow
can plot and plan in other ways. You all know the Crow,
or rather, to be exact, the American Crow, for there is
the Fish Crow and a southern relation, the Florida Crow,
and in all there are twenty-five different kinds in North
America alone. This Common Crow is very plentiful here,
as he is in almost all parts of the United States, where
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
he makes his home from the Mexican border up to the fur
countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do you know that this Crow is cousin to the Blue
Jay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How funny! What makes them cousins?—for they
don’t look a bit alike, and they’re not the same colour or
anything,” said Sarah, Tommy, and Dave, almost together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that is true, but colour and feathers have nothing
to do with bird relationship any more than coloured
hair has to do with human families, and you can see that
here among yourselves. The Baltimore Oriole, Meadowlark,
Bobolink, and Purple Grackle all belong in one
family, and yet how unlike they seem. It is the construction
of the bird’s body and its habits and traits that serve
the Wise Men as guides to their grouping, and in these
traits the two are much alike, for Mr. Chapman, who knows
all about these birds, whether as museum specimens, where
he can study their bones, or as wild birds in the trees,
where he watches them day in and day out, says, ‘Our
Crows and Jays inhabit wooded regions, and, although
they shift about to a limited extent, they are resident
throughout the year, except at the northern limits of
their range. They are omnivorous feeders, taking fruits,
seeds, insects, eggs, nestlings, etc. Crows and Jays exhibit
marked traits of character and are possessed of
unusual intelligence. Some scientists place them at the
top of the tree of bird-life, and if their mental development
be taken into consideration they have undoubted
claim to high rank.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, also, that here is a Wise Man who believes
that birds have intelligence that implies thinking, and
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
this is different from the mere inherited instinct that
teaches animals how to obtain food, self-protection, etc.
There are people who believe that they are the only wise
animals, and deny that birds and beasts can think; while
there are others who try to make these birds and beasts
think on the same lines as ourselves rather than in their
own way. Both these are wrong; both are like blind men
that lead others into a ditch and leave them there. The
only way for you and me to do is to watch out for ourselves,
look carefully, and be very sure that we see what
is, and not merely what we would like to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I will tell you what I, myself, have seen and know,
and what others, whose word is guaranteed by the Wise
Men, have seen concerning Crows and Jays. When I was
a child, twenty-five years ago, riding my pony, I wandered
all over the country-side with my father, and I knew
every Crow roost and Hawk’s nest for miles, and for many
years after I watched their comings and goings. Late
last winter, when I came back to the dear home to live,
I went out to the nearest of the old Crow roosts in the
cedar woods yonder across the river (you can see the
tree-tops plainly from this window), and, in spite of time
and changes, a flock of Crows was still there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure, the flock was smaller, and there were
fewer Cedars, many having been turned into fence and
gate posts. But the Crows, big, black, solemn things as
they are, seemed to give me a welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The life of the Crow is dull if judged, perhaps, from
the standpoint of the birds that make long journeys, such
as the Swallows, Humming-birds, and the Night Hawk
(that isn’t a Hawk at all), who nest in the far North and
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
go back to spend the winter in Central or South
America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet all we stay-at-home people know how much can
happen even here in Fair Meadows township, and, if we
extend our territory from salt water, or the southeast, to
the hickory woods beyond the Grist-Mill on the northwest,
there is room enough for happenings that would
make an exciting life for any pair of Crows. For in considering
Crows, we must take the life of a pair, one of
their good traits being their personal and race fidelity,
and when they mate, it is usually for life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is middle autumn now; what are the Crows doing?
All through August and early fall they have been feeding
good on grasshoppers, caterpillars, locusts, and cutworms.
This flock that roost in the cedar woods are doing that
which occupies most of a bird’s time in season and out,
working for a living, and in doing this they are searching
the grass meadows and ploughed fields for insects of every
sort and description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Their time of mischief is over for the year. The corn
is cut and stacked; they may if they please tear the husks
from the cobs and then reach the corn, but they are not
fond of tough, dry corn, though, of course, they eat it when
really hungry. But just now there is plenty to be gleaned
from the field, and when the winter hungry time comes,
the good corn will be stored safe in the granaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every night, before sunset, the Crows of the flock
leave the various feeding-places in twos and threes, and
flap across country in a leisurely fashion toward the roost,
where they spend their nights all the year except during
the nesting season. They return thus in little parties, if
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
there is no cause for fear, but should a man with a gun,
a large Owl, or other suspicious object appear, either the
Crow on the watch, for there is always one of these who
guards the destiny of the flock, gives a signal by a sharp
quavering Ca-ca-w or, if this seems too rash, the leader
will simply take to wing and slip away silently, and, no
matter how quietly the leader slips away, the rest of the
flock know it and rise at once. How do they know
this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe they smell, just as our rabbit hounds do when
they start out after things that no one else sees or knows
about,” said Tommy Todd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, birds are not guided by scent as animals are,”
said Gray Lady; “scent is held to the ground by moisture;
it would be difficult to follow when it is blown about by
air. Birds are led by their sight, which is many times
keener than that of man or the lower animals. Then, too,
they have another sense more fully developed than other
animals, and that is what is called the ‘sense of direction.’
Knowing the spot to which they would go, they are able
to reach it in the quickest, most direct manner, so that
‘as the Crow flies’ has come to mean the most direct
way of reaching a place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When morning comes they leave the roost, and, breaking
up into parties, begin the search for food again. As
the supply near home gives out, they go farther and farther
afield, sometimes going down to the shore, where they
pick up clams, mussels, and any scraps of sea-food that
they can find.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After the corn has been taken in, they find scattered
kernels of that and other grain left in the field, but at the
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
first snowfall hard times set in for the Crow. He cannot
search the bark crevices for insects like the small tree-trunk
birds with slender bills; people do not welcome him
to their farm-yards and scatter grain for him, or leave
him free to glean, as they do the other winter birds. It is
at this time, when the hand of man is turned against him,
that the Crow really works in man’s interest by catching
meadow-mice and many other small destructive animals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At this time, the Crow eats frozen apples, poison-ivy
berries, acorns, beech and chestnuts, and the like. But
now he grows poor and thin and his voice is querulous,
and from November to March the Crow is put to it for a
living. ‘Poor as a Crow’ is an apt saying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the thawing out of the ground in spring, the
Crow begins to view the world differently. The search
for insects still continues, and the corn now gleaned is
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
more palatable, for it has been well soaked, and though a
corn-eater by nature, the Crow does not like his too hard
and dry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The flock life of the roost now ends. Every Jack
chooses his Jill, and mingled with the harsh warning cries
of the older birds are sounds that sometimes have a suggestion
that their makers are trying to sing. The funniest
thing in birdland is to see a Crow or a Purple Grackle
making love, standing on tiptoe on a branch, raising their
wings by jerks, like pump-handles that are stiff, while the
sounds they make stick in the throat in a manner that
suggests Crow croup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once in a long time, however, I have heard a Crow
begin with a high Caw, and then followed a series of soft,
almost musical, notes, though without tune or finish, but
this is the exception. But what, in his courting days, a
Crow lacks in song, he makes up by wonderful feats of
flight. For his size, the Crow is always a graceful bird on
the wing. When he flaps slowly up against the wind,
there is nothing laboured in his motions, but in the spring,
in company with a desired mate, his swift dives into the
air, wheels to right and left, circlings often finished by a
series of somersaults across the sky, are really marvellous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now the pair of Crows that we will call Jack and Jill,
to save time, leave the cedar woods and begin hunting
for a nesting-site. At first they looked through the
hickory woods for an old Hawk’s nest for a foundation
upon which to build, but this year there were two Red-tailed
Hawks already in possession, and so they hurried
away as quickly as possible, for Hawks do not like Crows,
and tell them so very plainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
“Next day they spied the great white pine back of
Farmer Boardman’s barn. They liked the looks of the
tree, for it had a bunch of closely knit branches near the
top, and the neighbourhood in all respects promised good
feeding, but before they had carried more than a few coarse
sticks and put them in place, the farmer’s man saw them,
and not only fired his gun at them to drive them away,
but climbed the tree and threw the sticks away in order
to be sure that they should not rest there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did Jack and Jill do next? They came flying
over here. The place was attractive, and it was easy to
slip from the pine woods to the hickories, then across to
the orchard, and up to the spruce trees outside the window
here. Goldilocks was too ill to come up into the playroom
then, and so the windows on this side of the attic were
shut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The nest-building began in earnest, both birds working
at it. First, a foundation of stout sticks, some of
them being half-dead twigs from these same spruces; then,
old weed stalks and vine tendrils, mixed with corn husks,
until a heap was collected that would fill a half-bushel
basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This was the outside of the house; the nursery itself was
hollowed in the centre of the moss and was about a foot
across and quite deep. This hollow was well lined and
soft; it had in it moss, soft grasses, and some horsehair.
In due time the nest was finished and held six very
handsome eggs, dull green with purplish brown markings,
two being more thickly spattered with them than the
other four. At this time I began to take an interest in
the household affairs of Jack and Jill Crow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
“How could you?—can you climb trees?” asked Eliza
Clausen, evidently much surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I couldn’t climb as far as this Crow’s nest, Eliza,
though I could have once,” laughed Gray Lady. “Stand
up on that seat by the corner window and look straight
down into the spruce with a crooked top and tell me what
you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eliza jumped up on the seat, and, after gazing a minute,
cried, “Why, it’s a big ’normous nest, and I can see every
stick as plain as print.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take this opera-glass, hold it to your eyes and move
the screw to and fro until everything is very clear, and then
tell me what you see,” said Gray Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took Eliza some time to manage the glass, but when
she at last succeeded she cried, “Oh, I can see the moss
and the grass and the hair; it comes as near as if I could
touch it.” And one after another the children learned to
adjust the focus and look, and it was the first, but not the
last, time that glasses would open a new world to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a little less than three weeks that the birds
sat upon the eggs, sharing the work between them, before
the little birds were hatched. Such ugly, queer little
things as they were, both blind and featherless. In three
weeks more they were well grown and able to fly, but their
tails were still shorter than their parents’, and they were
inclined to return to the nest on the slightest alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About this time Jacob Hughes told me that either
Crows or Hawks were taking little chickens early every
morning, for they could not get them during the daytime
without being seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I looked at the runs for the little chicks and saw that
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
they stood in the open, not close to woods where Crows
and Hawks could spy them out and sneak up or dash
down according to their habits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I well knew the bad name that Crows and Hawks have
among poultry-raisers, so Jacob roofed the chicken-runs
with wire, for, even if he had seen Crows there, I would not
allow shooting on the place during the nesting season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still the chickens disappeared, and for several nights
Jacob sat up and watched, and what do you suppose—cats
and weasels were the guilty ones, not the Hawks and
Crows!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But late in May the Crows prepared to raise their
second brood, mending their old nest, and Jacob said,
‘Something is robbing the nests in the orchard; I think
surely it is the Crows and Jays, for when they come
around all the song-birds chase them and say right out
as plain as possible, “They’re thieves—they’re thieves!” ’
So I watched from behind the blinds yonder, and in every
spot where I could see into the tree-tops and be unobserved—and
then I knew it was true that the Crows
and Jays were detestable cannibals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One single morning I saw the Crow take three robin’s
eggs and bring a tiny little robin squab to his mate on
the nest, and one day, as a Crow flew high over my head,
I thought I saw something strange in its beak, and clapped
my hands sharply, when—what do you think? A poor
little half-dead Wood Thrush, big enough to have its eyes
open and some feathers, dropped almost on my upturned
face, and thus the Crow was caught in the very act of
killing. So, then, I said to myself, we can put tar on the
seed-corn and protect our young chickens with wire, but
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
we cannot make up for the death of young nestlings and
the loss of eggs. I will not have the Crows shot, because
they do good in the far meadows and hayfields, but the
lonely woods, where few small birds nest, is the place for
them. I shall see that they never again build in my
garden orchard or woods, and if every one will do this, the
danger to song-birds will be less, and in the winter, when
they come about, there are no nestlings to be eaten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not long after that, owing to the evidence of
my own eyes, I was obliged to say the same thing to the
Blue Jay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Wise Men say that, take it all in all, the Crow
should have a chance, and that part of his faults come
from our own shiftlessness. This is true, but if he feeds
upon song-birds the Crow must go.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><a id='jay3'></a><span class='it'>The Blue Jay</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“That the Blue Jay is a handsome fellow goes without
saying, as well as that he has plenty of assurance and is
somewhat of a bully. We may imagine that he knows
that his uniform of blue, gray, and white, with black bands
and markings, is very becoming, and if any one of you
should tell me that he had seen a Jay admiring his reflection
in a pond or little pool, I should be ready to believe
him. Certain it is that not one of our birds, not even the
glowing Scarlet Tanager, presents a more neat and military
appearance.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“The only awkward thing about the Blue Jay is his
flight. Although alert and agile in slipping through the
trees, when he takes to wing his progress seems laboured,
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
as if either his body was too heavy for his wings, or that
the wings were stiff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like the Crow, his cousin, this Jay belongs to all
north-eastern America, making its home from Florida to
Newfoundland, and, like the Crow, we have some members
of its family with us in New England all the
winter, when it is certainly a pleasure to see them flying
through the bare trees or gathering food on the pure
white snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Jay does not annoy the farmer by pulling corn, nor
trouble the chicken yard; for eight or nine months he
earns an honest living, largely of vegetable food and
harmful insects, snails, tree frogs, mice, small fish, and
lizards, but in the breeding season, alas! he is a nest
robber, and here in my own garden and orchard I have
seen him this summer dodging and trying to avoid the
angry birds that were pursuing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twice I heard nestling Robins twittering as they do
when their parents come with food, but, like the wolf
disguised as Red Riding-Hood’s Grandmother, it was a
Jay who came to the nest and seized a squab, as my
eyes saw and the cries of the parent birds told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I said to Jacob, ‘We will not let the Jays build in
Birdland; they must be outcasts and go out and live in
the far-away woods with the Crows, where there are few
small birds.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can we keep them out, you ask? It does take
a little time and patience, to be sure, but if we watch when
they begin to build and take away the sticks, you may be
very sure that they will take the hint and go elsewhere,
for they are quick-witted birds. So, perhaps, in time they
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
would learn, at least in some regions, to inhabit places
where mice and other harmful rodents and bugs are
more plentiful than song-birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then in the winter we of the Kind Hearts’ Club can
make up for this seeming unkindness, and pay them for
the real good they do by feeding them through the hungry
time, when nuts, berries, and even frozen apples are not
to be found.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is a Blue Jay’s nest like? I don’t think I’ve
ever seen one,” asked Tommy Todd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not very easy to find, for they usually build rather
high up, in a place where the limb is crotched and has
many small branches. The nest itself is well made of
fibres and roots, and is usually quite cleverly hidden, and
the eggs are dull green, very thickly spotted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aside from the Jay’s unaccountable cannibal habit of
egg and squab hunting, he has many good qualities, both
as a parent and a friend to those of his own kind, and
though his call is harsh, and, like the creaking of the
Grackles, a reminder of coming frosts and bare trees, in
spring he has some pretty melodious notes and another
call totally different from the harsh jay, jay. This cry
is like the resonant striking of two bits of metal, a clink
without exactly the ring that a bell has,—yet I call it the
‘bell note,’ though perhaps the double sound produced
by hammer and anvil is a better comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the fall, however, the Jay’s voice is certainly harsh,
and not only lacks anything like musical quality, but is
so harsh that when there are many about the noise is
really annoying. The poet Lathrop describes the change
so well that I will read it to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One trait belongs to this bird that I have never seen
recorded of any other, though, of course, it may be common
to all, and that is the care of the aged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To care for the young, even among people, is an instinct
as strong as self-protection. To care for the aged implies
a good heart and a certain amount of unselfishness. This
story is written down by Major Bendire, in his book on the
<span class='it'>Life Histories of American Birds</span>. He lived much with the
birds, and saw so truly that the Wise Men believe what he
records.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Mr. Firth to Major Bendire</span>,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made some observations last summer on the habits of the
Blue Jay, which certainly show a degree of sympathy and
kindness worthy of imitation of animals of a higher order. Last
August (1887), on an old farm in Jefferson County, Wisconsin,
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
my attention was attracted by the notes of a Blue Jay, not the
ordinary cry, but a series of regular calls, followed by answers
from a neighbouring tree. There was something so peculiarly
like a communication of thought about the sound that I went
to the place, and saw an old Blue Jay perched on a fence some
distance from the tree where there were others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On my nearing the bird, the calls from the others became
more frequent and loud, changing from a low, pleasant communicative
tone to shrill alarm. Thinking that he was injured in
some way, I went up to him and found that at least he was
partially blind. The eyes were blurred and dim, the beautiful
blue feathers were faded; in fact, the general appearance of the
bird was so different as to be seen at a glance; the claws were
worn, the bill dulled, and the wings and tail ragged. Every
feature suggested old age and feebleness. Yet he was watched
and cared for as tenderly as ever a growing bird in the nest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had I caught him than there were at least a dozen
Jays close at hand whose sympathy and interest were manifest
as clearly as could be with words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a thorough examination I let him go, when he flew in
the direction of the sound of the others, but did not succeed in
alighting among the smaller branches of the tree, and finally
settled on a large limb near the ground. I saw him, after that,
every day for a week, and never did his companions desert him,
some one of them being always near and warning him of danger,
when he would fly toward the sound of their voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They guided him regularly to a spring near by, where I saw
him bathe daily, always, however, with some of his companions
close by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They not only watched and guided him, but they fed him.
I had noticed, some days before, Jays carrying food and thought
it strange at that season, as there were no young to feed, but
found afterwards, to my surprise and pleasure, that the poor,
blind bird was being fed by those he could no longer see.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“So you see the Jay, with all his bad tricks and nest-robbing,
has his good points, and we will not shoot him,
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
but hint very strongly, if necessary, that he had better
nest away from the temptation that garden and orchards
offer in the shape of eggs and fresh meat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Gray Lady ended, a great commotion arose in the
neighbourhood of the orchard. Jays screamed and Crows
cawed, as if, Goldilocks said, they knew that they were
being talked about, and didn’t like it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady opened one of the windows and looked out.
Below stood Jacob, waving his hat to attract attention,
saying through his hands, “There are some Screech
Owls on a branch of the old willow back of the orchard,
and the other birds have found it out. The Crows are
mixing in and there’s a great how-de-do. I thought maybe
you would all like to see them, only I couldn’t go up
for fear they might shift away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course they wished to see, and it was quite remarkable
how fifteen usually noisy children managed to tiptoe
through the orchard and avoid sticks and dry leaves.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'>(Told at Foxes Corners School)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='mig'></a>I was telling Grand’ther about how far away the birds<a id='travels'></a>
go in the winter, and how they fly against the lighthouses
and get killed,” said Tommy Todd, “and he said I couldn’t
tell him anything about their going away and coming back,
’cause he’d seen that going on, boy and man, these seventy
years. Grand’ther knows how the same kind of birds
come back to the place every spring, ’cause he says there
were Phœbe Birds had a nest on the end beam of the cowshed
over where the last cow stands,—way back when he
was learning to milk. Then when that old shed blew
down, and they built a new one like it, back the birds came,
and they are coming yet; first nest over Black Bess, and
second nest way out over the box-pen where the little
calves live.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What Grand’ther wants to know is how they find
the way to go so far, and how they know where to
stop and find something to eat, and if they get hungry,
’cause he says nobody seems to know just what they do
between times, and what people do tell seems like Jack-and-the-Beanstalk
fairy-stories, and he said maybe you
had some book that told about it so’s you could explain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
Gray Lady smiled in a half-puzzled way, as Tommy
spoke, for the questions that the children asked often
gave her as much cause for study and wonder as the
stories that she told them. She was finding out that
there were three or four members of the Kind Hearts’ Club
who had been seeing correctly and trying to think out
things for themselves before they had a chance to ask
questions, or had any books to consult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your grandfather’s question cannot be answered in a
few words,” she said, “neither is there any one book that
tells everything about these wonderful journeys, because,
as yet, not the very wisest of the Wise Men know it all,
though they wait and watch, and every spring and fall
many of them are scattered through the country upon
the course of the flying birds to watch them as they
pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the information that they collect is printed and
kept as evidence of what is known, a little here and a
little there, until we hope some day that the history will
be complete, when it will be one of the most wonderful
stories in the world, for even the little we know sounds
like a fairy-tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” continued Gray Lady, “I know very little
from my own sight, but I will tell you what I have learned
of the Wise Men, who believe it to be the truth. I had
intended telling you about Owls and Hawks to-day, as I
promised you last week, when we saw the Screech Owl
up in the orchard, but that story can wait until the next
time you visit Birdland, for the Owls are still about; there
are pictures of them in the library, and others that are
stuffed and mounted in the glass case in the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
“All that we need, or that can help us with the story of
the bird on its travels, is that large map of North and
South America, for this will be a geography, as well as a
bird, lesson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(A fine map of the western hemisphere having been
the first thing that Gray Lady had given Miss Wilde for
the use of the school at Foxes Corners, the little old one
being out of date and indistinct.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clary, you may take charge of the pointer to-day and
sit here by me, for this will be a rather long lesson, and you
will need help with the binding of your iron-holder, for
I’m afraid if you draw the stitches so very tight it will
pucker and not lie flat and smooth like the model that Ann
Hughes made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what work has Jacob given you boys for your
penknives to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wooden spoons out of white wood,” answered Dave,
“big strong ones such as’ll beat up cake and apple-sauce,
and, when they’re shaped, we are to smooth them down
fine with sandpaper. I’m going to give mine to my
mother; she broke hers yesterday, the handle snapped
right in two. She says the bought spoons are sawn out
crossgrain, any which way. There was an old man who
used to come down from the charcoal camp with wooden
spoons and butter-scoops and hickory baskets, and he
sold lots of ’em all through the town, but he died last
winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then surely wooden spoons and butter-scoops will be
very good things for the Kind Hearts’ Club to make for
its Christmas sale, and we shall be interfering with nobody,
for that is one of the things that we must remember when
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
we are working for charity, not to make articles for sale
that shall interfere with others who make them to get an
honest living, for that sort of thing is a species of robbery
in disguise.</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>The Travels of Birds</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“What becomes of the birds that are with us in summer?
Where and how do they spend the winter? By what
roadways do they travel to their winter haunts? Do they
prefer to journey by land or by water, and how do they
find the way?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We need not think that we, or anybody else of our day,
are the first to ask these questions, for it is many hundreds
of years since they first began to puzzle thinking
people. At first, lacking any real knowledge of the simplest
facts of nature, and not having as yet trained the
eye to correct seeing, the people did as the ignorant do
to this day,—they imagined fabulous reasons. The more
impossible and wonderful or unnatural, the better, for
it takes a trained mind oftentimes to realize that the
most natural way is the best, and that the simplest way
is the most natural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was in these far-back times that the foolish idea was
started that the Swallows dived into the mud and there
spent the winter, like the frogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another stranger idea was that small birds crossed
large bodies of water as passengers on the backs of large
birds, such as Cranes, Ducks, and Geese, for people did
not know enough of the structure of birds to realize that
the machinery of the tiny Humming-bird is as fit for flying
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
long distances as that of the biggest birds that grow.
Ideas like this have been believed until a comparatively
short time ago, and it is only within the last fifty years
that there has been much real progress toward the truth
of it all. And this is the way it has been brought about.
In our country the band of Wise Men at Washington,
forming the United States Biological Survey, have for
twenty years been gathering facts about the migration
of birds. This body has sent out naturalists to travel
through the North American continent from Guatemala
to the Arctic Circle, to meet with other scientific men on
their way, and keep careful notes of what they see, so that
reports are had in the spring and fall each year from
hundreds of observers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These reports give the date upon which each particular
kind (or species, as they call it) of bird is seen, when
it becomes plenty, and when it moves on again. The
lighthouse keepers also give much information by noting
the times at which they find the birds that are dashed to
death against the lanterns in the tower. In short, the
Wise Men have more material at hand than ever before
from which to shape the story that day by day increases
in wonder.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Causes of the Migrations</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“It is more than two thousand years since the wonders
of bird travel have been noted; and while the distances
and routes of travel are better known, we cannot yet give a
positive answer to the question, ‘Why do birds migrate?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, Gray Lady,” said Sarah Barnes, “I thought
you said it was because in fall the insect food begins to
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
freeze and give out, and they go south after it and in
spring they want to go back home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Sarah, that is one of the reasons, and yet birds
start off oftentimes when food is still plenty, and every
naturalist knows of the rush of the water-fowl northward
so early every spring that they are often turned back by
storms and have to retrace their flight, and they have
all seen that Robins, Bluebirds, and Swallows, following
too closely in the wake of the water-fowl, sometimes
lose hundreds out of their flocks by cold and starvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the fall journey is caused by lack of food, why
does it begin when food is most plenty? At some of
the Florida lighthouses the Wise Men have seen that
the southward trip with some birds begins between the
first and middle of July, at the time when the crop of
insects and ripe seeds and berries is at its height. So
the best answer that can be made is that ages ago, when
the migrations began, they were connected with a food
supply that changed more suddenly than at the present
time, and that, even when the direct motive is lost, the
habit remains fixed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it; that’s a bully reason!” cried Tommy
Todd, excitedly. “They’ve got the notion that they’re
going travelling just so often and they can’t calculate
the time right and so they get ready too soon; likely
they haven’t got very good heads for planning. That’s
the reason, Pop says, that every fall, when Ma and Aunt
Hannah go up to Kent to visit Grandma Tuck, they are
all ready on the stoop by half-past seven, when there’s
never been a train from here to there before ’leven. If
they were birds, they’d probably fly off as soon as it was
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
light, and get to Grandma’s for breakfast, when they’d
written on a picture postal, with tea-cups and a cat on
it, that she might expect them for supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the laugh at Tommy’s comparison had subsided,
Gray Lady said, “Your idea is by no means a
foolish one, and it may be that a boy like you, who
watches and thinks, will some day piece the facts together
that will finally settle the question.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>How do Birds find their Way?</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“How do the birds find their way over the hundreds
or thousands of miles between the winter and summer
homes? Sight is probably the chief guide of those who
fly by day, and it is known that these day travellers
seldom make the long single flights that are so common
with the birds that journey at night. Sight, undoubtedly,
also guides them, to a large extent, in the night journeys,
when the moon is bright. Migrating birds fly high, so
that one can hardly hear their faint twittering. But
if the sky is obscured and the clouds hang low, the flocks
keep nearer to the earth, and their calls are more distinctly
heard; while on very dark nights, the vibration
of their wings can be heard close overhead.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>TERNS AND SKIMMERS ON THE WING</span><br/><span style='font-size:smaller'>(Summer Bird-Life, Cobbs Island, Va. Am. Museum Nat. Hist., N.Y.)</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Notwithstanding this, something besides sight guides
these travellers in the upper air. (Here is a route
for you to trace on the map.) In Alaska, a few years
ago, members of the Biological Survey on the Harriman
expedition went by steamer from the island of Unalaska
to Bogoslof Island, a distance of about sixty miles. A
dense fog had shut out every object beyond a hundred
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
yards. When the steamer was halfway across, flocks
of <a id='murre'></a>Murres, returning to Bogoslof after long quests for
food, began to break through the fog wall astern, fly
side by side with the vessels, and disappear in the mists
ahead. By chart and compass, the ship was heading
straight for the island; but its course was no more exact
than that taken by the birds. The power which carried
them unerringly home over the ocean wastes, whatever
its nature, may be called ‘a sense of direction.’ We
recognize in ourselves the possession of some such sense,
though imperfect and easily at fault. Doubtless a
similar, but vastly more acute, sense enabled the Murres,
flying from home and circling wide over the water, to
keep in mind the direction of their nests and return to
them without the aid of sight. It is probable that this
faculty is exercised during migration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reports from lighthouses in southern Florida show
that birds leave Cuba on cloudy nights when they cannot
possibly see the Florida shores, and safely reach their
destination, provided no change occurs in the weather.
But if meantime the wind changes or a storm arises to
throw them out of their reckoning, they become bewildered,
lose their way, and fly toward the lighthouse
beacon. Unless killed by striking the lantern, they
hover near or alight on the balcony, to continue their
flight when morning breaks, or, the storm ceasing, a
clear sky allows them once more to determine the proper
course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Birds flying over the Gulf of Mexico to Louisiana,
even if they ascended to the height of five miles, would
still be unable to see a third of the way across. Nevertheless
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
this trip is successfully made twice each year by
countless thousands of the warblers of the Mississippi
Valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably there are many short zigzags from one favoured
feeding-spot to another, but the general course
between the summer and winter homes is as straight as
the birds can find without missing the usual stopping-places.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Accidents during Migration</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Migration is a season full of peril for myriads of winged
travellers, especially for those that cross large bodies of
water. Some of the shore-birds, such as Plover and
Curlew, which take long ocean voyages, can rest on the
waves if overtaken by storms, but woe to the luckless
warbler whose feathers once became water-soaked,—a
grave in the ocean or a burial in the sand of the beach
is the inevitable result. Nor are such accidents infrequent.
A few years ago on Lake Michigan a storm
during spring migration piled many birds along the
shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If such a disaster could occur on a lake less than a
hundred miles wide, how much greater might it not be
during a flight across the Gulf of Mexico. Such a catastrophe
was once witnessed from the deck of a vessel,
thirty miles off the mouth of the Mississippi River.
Large numbers of migrating birds, mostly warblers,
had accomplished nine-tenths of their long flight, and
were nearing land, when they were caught by a ‘norther’
with which most of them were unable to contend, and,
falling into the Gulf, were drowned by hundreds.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
“Then, as I have told you before, birds are peculiarly
liable to destruction by striking high objects. A new
tower in a city kills many before the survivors learn to
avoid it. The Washington Monument has caused the
death of many little migrants; and though the number
of its victims has decreased of late years, yet on a single
morning in the spring of 1902 nearly 150 lifeless bodies
were strewn around its base.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bright lights attract birds from great distances. While
the torch in the Bartholdi Statue of Liberty in New
York Harbor was kept lighted, the sacrifice of life it
caused was enormous, even reaching a maximum of
700 birds in a month. A flashing light frightens birds
away, and a red light is avoided by them as if it were
a danger signal, but a steady white light looming out of
mist or darkness seems to act like a magnet and draws
the wanderers to destruction. Coming from any direction,
they veer around to the leeward side, and then,
flying against the wind, dash themselves against the
pitiless glass.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Distance of Migration</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“The length of the migration journey varies enormously.
Some birds do not migrate at all. <a id='card1'></a>Many a Cardinal,
Carolina Wren, and <a id='bobW1'></a>Bob-white rounds out its whole
contented life within ten miles of its birthplace. Other
birds, for instance, the Pine Warbler and the Black-headed
Grosbeak, do not venture in winter south of
the breeding range, so that with them fall migration is
only a withdrawal from the northern and a concentration
in the southern part of the summer home—the
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
Warbler in about a fourth and the Grosbeak in less than
an eighth of the summer area.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next variation is illustrated by the Robin, which
occurs as a species in the middle districts of the United
States throughout the year, in Canada only in summer,
and along the Gulf of Mexico only in winter. Probably
no individual Robin is a continuous resident in any section;
but the Robin that nests, let us say, in southern Missouri
will spend the winter near the Gulf, while his hardy
Canada-bred cousin will be the winter tenant of the
abandoned summer home of the southern bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most migrants entirely change their abode twice
a year, and some of them travel immense distances.
Of the land-birds, the common eastern Night Hawk seems
to deserve the first place among those whose winter
homes are widely distant from their breeding-grounds.
Alaska and Patagonia, separated by 115 degrees of
latitude, are the extremes of the summer and winter
homes of the bird, and each spring many a Night Hawk
travels the 5000 miles that lie between. But some of
the shore-birds are still more inveterate voyagers. These
cover from 6000 to 8000 miles each way, and appear to
make travelling their chief occupation.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Routes of Migration</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Birds often seem eccentric in choice of route, and many
land-birds do not take the shortest line. The fifty
species from New England that winter in South America,
instead of making the direct trip over the Atlantic, involving
a flight of 2000 miles, take a slightly longer route
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
which follows the coast of Florida, and passes thence,
by island or mainland, to South America. What would
seem, at first sight, to be a natural and convenient migratory
highway extends from Florida through the Bahamas
or Cuba to Haiti, Porto Rico, and the Lesser Antilles,
and thence to South America.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>The Bobolink Route</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Chief among these dauntless voyagers is the <a id='bobo3'></a>Bobolink,
fresh from despoiling the Carolina rice-fields, waxed
fat from his gormandizing, and so surcharged with
energy that the 500-mile flight to South America on
the way to the waving pampas of southern Brazil seems
a small hardship. Indeed, many Bobolinks appear to
scorn the Jamaican resting-point and to compass in
a single flight the 700 miles from Cuba to South America.
With the Bobolink is an incongruous company of travelling
companions—a Vireo, a King Bird, and a <a id='nhawk1'></a>Night
Hawk that summer in Florida; the queer Chuck-will’s-widow
of the Gulf States; the two New England Cuckoos;
the trim Alice’s Thrush from Quebec; the cosmopolitan
Bank Swallow from frozen Labrador, and the Black-poll
Warbler from far-off Alaska. But the Bobolinks
so far outnumber all the rest of the motley crew that
the passage across the Caribbean Sea from Cuba to
South America may with propriety be called the ‘Bobolink
route.’ Occasionally a mellow-voiced Wood Thrush
joins the assemblage, or a green-gold Tanager, which will
prepare in its winter home its next summer livery of
flaming scarlet. But the ‘Bobolink route,’ as a whole,
is not popular with other birds, and the many that
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
traverse it are but a fraction of the thousands of North
American birds that spend the winter holiday in South
America.</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you patience to follow the history of the flight
of one bird? The longest migration route is taken by
some of the wading-birds, especially the <a id='plovg'></a>American Golden
Plover, <a id='curl'></a>the Eskimo Curlew, and the Turnstone. The
journey of the Plover, in itself like a fable, is wonderful
enough to be told in detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the first week of June, they arrive at their breeding-grounds
in the bleak, wind-swept ‘barren grounds’
above the Arctic Circle, far beyond the tree line. Some
even venture 1000 miles farther north (Greely found
them at latitude 81 degrees). While the lakes are still
ice-bound, they hurriedly fashion shabby little nests
in the moss only a few inches above the frozen ground.
By August, they have hastened to Labrador, where, in
company with Curlews and <a id='turn'></a>Turnstones, they enjoy a
feast. Growing over the rocks and treeless slopes of
this inhospitable coast is a kind of heather, the crowberry,
bearing in profusion a juicy black fruit. The
extravagant fondness shown for the berry by the birds,
among which the Curlew, owing to its greater numbers,
is most conspicuous, causes it to be known to the natives
as the ‘curlewberry.’ The whole body of the Curlew
becomes so saturated with the dark-purple juice that
birds whose flesh was still stained with the colour have
been shot 1000 miles south of Labrador.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>GOLDEN PLOVER</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“After a few weeks of such feasting, the Plovers become
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
excessively fat, and ready for their great flight.
They have reared their young under the midnight sun,
and now they seek the southern hemisphere. After
gaining the coast of Nova Scotia, they strike straight
out to sea, and take a direct course for the easternmost
islands of the West Indies. Eighteen hundred miles of
ocean waste lie between the last land of Nova Scotia
and the first of the Antilles, and yet 600 more to the
eastern mainland of South America, their objective
point. The only land along the route is the Bermuda
Islands, 800 miles from Nova Scotia. In fair weather,
the birds fly past the Bermudas without stopping; indeed,
they are often seen by vessels 400 miles or more east of
these islands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When they sight the first land of the Antilles, the flocks
often do not pause, but keep on to the larger islands
and sometimes even to the mainland of South America.
Sometimes a storm drives them off the main track,
when they seek the nearest land, appearing not infrequently
at Cape Cod and Long Island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A few short stops may be made in the main flight, for
the Plover swims lightly, and easily, and has been seen
resting on the surface of the ocean; and shore-birds
have been found busily feeding 500 miles south of Bermuda
and 1000 miles east of Florida, in the Atlantic,
in that area known as the Sargasso Sea, where thousands
of square miles of seaweed teem with marine life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though feathered balls of fat when they leave Labrador
and still plump when they pass the Bermudas, the Plovers
alight lean and hungry in the Antilles. Only the first,
though the hardest, half of the journey is over. How
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
many days it has occupied may never be known. Most
migrants either fly at night and rest in the day or vice
versa, but the Plover flies both night and day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After a short stop of three or four weeks in the Antilles
and on the north-eastern coast of South America, the
flocks disappear, and later their arrival is noted at the
same time in southern Brazil and the whole prairie region
of Argentina and Patagonia. Here they remain from
September to March (the summer of the southern hemisphere),
free from the responsibilities of the northern
summer they have left. The native birds of Argentina
are at the time engrossed in family cares; but, <span class='it'>remember
this well, no wayfarer from the north nests in the south; he
has a second summer free from care!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“After a six months’ vacation the Plovers resume the
serious affairs of life and start back toward the Arctic
zone, but not by the same course. Their full northward
route is a problem still unsolved. They disappear from
Argentina and shun the whole Atlantic coast from Brazil
to Labrador. In March they appear in Guatemala and
Texas; April finds their long lines trailing across the
prairies of the Mississippi valleys; the first of May sees
them crossing our northern boundary; and by the first
week in June they reappear at their breeding-grounds
in the frozen North. What a journey! Eight thousand
miles of latitude separates the extremes of their course,
and 3000 miles of longitude constitutes the shorter
diameter, and all for the sake of spending ten weeks on
an Arctic coast! Do you realize this endurance when
you see birds passing that window?</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
“As to the fatigue of the bird from travel, this is now
thought to be very slight, as bird flocks that have crossed
great bodies of water do not stop to rest, but usually
continue many miles inland. It is, undoubtedly, accident
or illness that sometimes causes birds to stop for rest on
the rigging of vessels or offshore islands.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>The Unknown</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Interest in bird migration goes back to a far distant
period. Marvellous tales of the spring and fall movements
of birds were spun by early observers, yet hardly less
incredible are the ascertained facts. Much remains to
be learned, and it may be of interest to note a few of the
mysteries which still occupy attention. Even the daily
flight of a bird is a wonderful thing apart from the endurance
required in the long migrations. Though the
wings of birds are built on very much the same plan, few
species use them in precisely the same manner; while
on a windy day the wings assume a dozen different
positions in as many seconds, and to watch the flight of a
sea-bird, as it rises and trims itself to the wind and then
shapes its course, is to be awe-struck by this mysterious
power of flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Snap shot pictures of birds on the wing will show you
this better than many words. Some birds, like the Hawks
and Eagles, can sustain themselves in the air for hours,
sailing against the wind without any visible motion of the
wings. Others fly both by swift beating and sailing,
like the Terns in one of these pictures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In short, the differences are so great that the Wise Men
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
can often identify a bird by the sharp outline of its shadow
in flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This power of flight has been a subject of wonder for
many thousand years; we think and we speculate, but no
one has yet learned the secret in its fulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The way of an eagle in the air! This is too wonderful
for me!’ is an expression of this feeling of mystery, recorded
in the book of Proverbs. One thing seems quite
certain, however—if man ever succeeds in conquering the
air and sailing through it, it will not be by the power of any
invention of his own, but because he has at least in
some degree mastered the knowledge of the flight of the
bird and adapted it to his own use.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='swift2'></a>“The Chimney Swift, that you all know as the Chimney
Swallow, is one of the most abundant and best-known birds
of the eastern part of the United States. With troops of
fledglings, catching their winged prey as they go, and lodging
by night in some tall chimney, the flocks drift slowly
south, joining with other bands until, on the northern coast
of the Gulf of Mexico, they become an innumerable host.
Then they disappear. Did they drop into the water and
hibernate in the mud, as was believed of old, their obliteration
could not be more complete. In the last week in
March a joyful twittering far overhead announces their
return to the Gulf coast, but the intervening five months
is still the Swifts’ secret.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The mouse-coloured Bank Swallows, that we saw here
in flocks a few weeks ago, are almost cosmopolitan, and
enliven even the shores of the Arctic Ocean with their
graceful aerial evolutions. Those that nest in Labrador
allow a scant two months for building a nest and raising
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
a brood, and by the first of August are headed southward.
Six weeks later they are swarming in the vicinity of Chesapeake
Bay, and then they, too, pass out of the range of our
knowledge. In April they appear in northern South
America, moving north, but not a hint do they give of how
they came there. The rest of the species, those that
nest to the south or west, may be traced farther south, but
they, too, fail to give any clew as to where they spend the
five winter months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which one of the Wise Men can tell us? No one.
Look out the window now; there are two Night Hawks,
first flying high and then dropping suddenly through
the air. Is it not hard to realize that, while you are going
to and fro every day between your homes and school,
and by and by having to dig paths through the snow in
order to get there, those two slender birds will have flown
5000 miles to find a new summer, and will be having a
vacation absolutely free from family cares?”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Owls and Hawks</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>Frost had come. Real frost, with black, nipping fingers.
White frost, at its first appearance, is a decorator who casts
a silver spell upon the meadows, turning them into shimmering
lakes and touching the ripe leaves until each one
becomes a banner of scarlet, gold, or russet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chrysanthemums and tufts of self-sown pansies, huddling
in warm nooks, were the only flowers left about the
farm-houses or in Gray Lady’s garden, and both of these
would hold their own until Thanksgiving Day gave praise
for the year’s growth and bade growing things sleep the
long sleep of winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Birdland showed the change less than either the hickory
or the river woods, for the old orchard held its leaves as
apple trees usually do, and the belt of spruces and pines,
that ran from the north side of it quite up to the house,
made a cheerful green barrier and wind-break as well; but
the Swallows and Night Hawks were no longer skimming
the air, and high above, <a id='hawk5'></a>a pair of Red-shouldered Hawks
were sailing majestically, occasionally giving their cry
Kee-o—Kee-o!</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i191.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0014' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>RED-SHOULDERED HAWK</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Jacob had finished the Martin house the week previous,
and a stout smooth pole like a flagstaff had been planted,
not in Birdland itself but on a slight rise in the ground
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
that overlooked both the barns and the orchard. The
setting up of the house itself had been reserved for this
special Saturday, so that the children might take part
in the ceremony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The top of the pole, on which there were fastened crosspieces
to make a foundation for the house, was thirty feet
above the ground. In this pole stout spikes were driven
at intervals. This not only would prevent cats from
climbing up to the house, but made a sort of ladder by
which a man or boy could go up and pull out the nesting
material of English sparrows if they tried to take possession.
For, if we are to keep the useful insect-eating birds about
our houses, we must try our best to keep this Sparrow
from living amongst us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hard as it seems, he must be classed with animals that
the kindest heart knows must be destroyed. But no one
wishes to hurt nestlings, so the best way to do is to prevent
the old birds from building in the haunts of the useful
song-birds, and then in winter, when the old Sparrows
gather in flocks about the barnyard, have some grown
man, with good judgment and aim, shoot them. Children
should never be let do this for amusement, for it is not well
to allow a painful necessity to become a sport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy Todd was quite late on this Saturday morning,
so that it was thought that he was not coming, and when
he did arrive he found the others gathered about the pole,—Dave,
who had a steady head for climbing, having been
allowed to go up with Jacob, after the house had been
raised with a block and falls, to hold hammer and nails
while it was securely fastened to the braces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all so busy that it was not until Jacob and
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
Dave had come down, that Gray Lady noticed the box
that Tommy had brought and which stood beside him,
the slats on top telling that it contained some live thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she turned to ask Tommy what he had brought,
Goldilocks came down the path in her chair, for though
she could walk quite well by this time, she was obliged to
be very careful, and Ann would not allow her to be on her
feet for more than an hour or two each day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The little Owls are back again and all sitting in a row
on a branch of the old russet beyond the lunch-counter.
There is a hollow in the trunk of the tree that I never
noticed before, and do you know, mother, I shouldn’t be
surprised if the nest had been in there, so, perhaps, if we
have something that they like on the lunch-counter, they’ll
come back next year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back? Aren’t you going to shoot them before
they get away?” asked Dave. “Because they might not
come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t want them to come back to be shot, but to
make more nests and live here,” said Goldilocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Live! why, folks <span class='it'>always</span> shoot Owls and Hawks! They
are very bad things, though I guess Hawks are the worst;
anyhow, there’s more of ’em. Just look at those big Hen-hawks
flying up yonder now; maybe you’d like them to
come and live in the orchard. If they did, they’d eat the
lunch off’n your counter, other birds and all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady, seeing by the expression of Dave’s face that
he could not quite understand any other view of the matter,
said: “Yes, Dave, you are right; people usually shoot
Hawks and Owls on sight—and have been doing so for
years. In fact, my own husband used to shoot them as a
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
matter of course, and he was one who never killed a song-bird
and who greatly preferred to hear the Grouse drumming
in the forest, the Woodcock singing and dancing in
the spring woods (yes, they both dance and sing and I will
tell you of them some day), and Bob-white telling his name
from the fence-rail, than to have them come on the table
ever so deliciously cooked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='hawk1'></a>But within the last ten or fifteen years the Wise Men
have found out a great deal more about these Owls and
Hawks—or Birds of Prey, as they are called, and they
know exactly what the work of these birds is in the great
plan of nature. Many of the facts they tell us of we can
see for ourselves if we have the patience to watch. Before
the country was settled by white men, and became what
we call ‘civilized,’ all of these birds of prey had their place,
but even now many of them are not only not hurtful to us,
but of distinct benefit. The difficulty is that we do not
stop to sift the facts and separate the good from the bad.
To the farmer, and particularly the poultry-raiser, the cry of
Hawk brings him out, quick as a flash, shot-gun in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if he will only realize that for every chicken or
pigeon one of these Hawks destroys, it in all probability
takes fifty rats, field-mice, short-tailed meadow-mice,
weasels, and red squirrels, he will see that he owes the
Hawk a debt of gratitude; for it is easier by far to protect a
poultry-yard from conspicuous things that fly above—like
Hawks and Owls—than to keep out the things that
crawl and creep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, before we go down to the orchard to see Goldilocks’
little <a id='owl1'></a>Screech Owls, let us see what Tommy Todd
has in this box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
<a id='screech'></a>“It’s only a Screech Owl that I found up in the pigeon-coop
this morning, but it’s such a different colour from the
gray ones we have here, that I brought it up for you to
see if it was a rare kind. I daren’t take it out because it
claws and bites so.” And Tommy took away the cloth that
partly covered the box, and there sat the bird with open,
yellow-rimmed eyes, with which he seemed to see with
difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Owl was no taller than a Robin, but his large, round
head and thickset body made him appear to be a much
larger bird. He had two ear tufts (or horns) of feathers,
a strong, curved beak, and powerful toes, lightly feathered,
ending in the hooked talons that mark the birds of prey,
that is, birds that prey, or feed, upon forms of animal life
other than defenceless insects, worms, etc. Its feathers
were a bright rusty red colour, streaked with black; its
underparts being more or less white, mixed with red and
black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Owls in the orchard are like this one, only they
are all gray and black,” said Goldilocks, after taking a
long look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps this is the father bird; you told us that if one
bird is a gayer colour than the other, it is generally the
father,” said Sarah Barnes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that is often the case, as I am glad to find that
you remember, but not with the Screech Owl, the most
common of American Owls, and one that is known under
many names—Mottled Owl, Gray Owl, and Red Owl.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>SCREECH OWL</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“There may be some gray birds and some red ones in the
same brood, but this does not depend upon sex, season, or
age. The strange difference is called by a long name,
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
‘dichromatism’ or two-colour phase, and this is one of the
things for which the Wise Men can give no positive reason;
so it is another question like those about the flight and
travels of the birds for one of you to find out in future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring the box up to the orchard, Tommy, and, after we
have seen the gray Screech Owls, you can open the door
and put the box in the tree and see what will happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before they reached the gate of Birdland, they heard
a commotion inside; Jays were screaming in a great state
of rage and alarm, and, as they drew nearer, another sound
blended with the screaming, a hissing sound like “shay—shay—shay,”
and the snapping of beaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Jays have found the Owls out, and they’re hopping
mad,” said Jacob, who was standing in the shelter of a
tree-trunk, enjoying the scene. “The Jays daren’t
really touch the Owls, only jeer, and the Owls only snap
their beaks and hiss in return because they don’t like to
fly out in bright light; all you get back by the fence and
watch out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children did as Jacob suggested and Tommy put
his box on top of the wall and, at a signal from Gray Lady,
unfastened the slats. At first the little Red Owl stretched
his neck and snapped his beak; then, as he heard the voices
of the Jays, he backed into the corner of the box and drew
himself up thin and long, so that he did not look like the
same bird that had been so plump and fluffy a few seconds
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just the way he did this morning when I found
him in the pigeon-house,” said Tommy; “in the dark he
didn’t look a bit like a bird, but more like a corn-cob on end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! look there, Gray Lady.” And Tommy pointed
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
at a tree behind that in which the five Owls were roosting.
“There is another Owl all by itself that the Jays haven’t
found out, and it’s all drawn up thin just like my red one.”
And, following the direction of his finger, the Owl was
plainly to be seen, but so rigid and motionless that it
might have been a moss-covered branch stump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We would better go in now,” said Gray Lady, after
they had watched for a few moments. “The Owls are
beginning to notice us, and I do not wish them to be driven
away until I have had a chance to photograph them.
Leave the box there, Tommy; with all this noise your
Owl cannot be expected to come out before night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if they are good birds, what was the red one doing
in Tommy’s pigeon-house?” asked Dave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably looking for mice or other vermin, or perhaps
shelter,” said Gray Lady, “for though they sometimes
eat large game, mice or smaller animals are easier food for
a tribe of Owls that sometimes grow only six inches high
and never to a foot in length. I will tell you a way to
convince yourselves and make sure of what Owls feed
upon without killing the Owls,” said Gray Lady, as, on
their way up to the play and work rooms, they went into
the library to look at some of the mounted birds in one
of the cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As Owls usually swallow their food whole, they take in
bones, fur, feathers, etc., that they cannot digest; these
portions are made up into little pellets called ‘Owl balls,’
and these are spit up before the real process of digestion
is begun, and if you search under the trees where owls
roost, you may often find these pellets for yourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe that is what these things are that I’ve found, for
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
ever so many days, below the porch of the pigeon-house,”
said Tommy, pulling a bunch of paper from his pocket;
“I guess the Red Owl meant to live there this winter.”
He spread out the paper before Gray Lady, who was now
sitting at the table turning over the pages of a large book
in red covers. It was a reference book, in two volumes,
that she often used to look up stories of the birds about
which the children asked. The name of the book was
<span class='it'>Life Histories of North American Birds</span>, and they were
written and collected by Major Bendire, who was both one
of the Wise Men and an officer in our army. Putting in a
mark at the page where Screech Owl began, she closed the
book and looked at the contents of the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Tommy,” she said presently, “these are not only
Owl balls, but there is the fur and bones of a mouse in
each.” And deftly separating the wads with the point of
a pair of scissors and taking out a tiny skull, she motioned
the children to look at it through a reading-glass, each one
in turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does the Screech Owl live everywhere in the United
States?” asked Dave, after he and Tommy had picked
out enough of the tiny bones from the fur to piece out the
entire skeleton of a mouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This same species of Screech Owl that we have here is
found all through the eastern part of North America, but
there is a Screech Owl, of some sort, to be found in the
other parts of the country; thus, there is a Florida
Screech Owl; one for California; another for the Rocky
Mountains; one for Mexico, and one for Puget Sound,
besides several others, and, of them all, the Rocky Mountain
Owl is said to be the handsomest.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
“We have several other owls that live hereabouts and
do good work by killing rats, mice, snakes, lizards, etc.
Of course, they also eat some birds, but they are so valuable
to the farmer that he can ill spare them, and if he cannot,
neither can we. Do you realize that it is really the farmer
that holds the life of the country in his hand? What good
would money and houses and clothes do us if we had no
food?—and it is the farmer who, by carrying out the
workings of nature, makes food possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These birds of prey divide time between them, the
Hawk works by day and the Owls at night and in the early
dawn; thus, ‘Nature, in her wisdom, puts a continuous
check upon the four-footed vermin of the ground.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our little Screech Owls love old orchards and the
hollow trees to be found there, and they are well suited
to be guardians of the fruit trees. In hard winters, mice
and rabbits will often eat the bark of young peach, pear,
plum, and apple trees in such a way as to ruin them.
Who can keep a constant watch upon them by day and
night so well as the Hawks and Owls?—and if they do
take an occasional chicken or pigeon, these are more
easily replaced than fruit trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, too, our little Screech Owl is a destroyer of cutworms,
those dreadful worms that do their work by night.
For this alone, should the farmer call this Owl his friend,
and let him nest in any little hollow under the barn eaves,
or in the old willow or sycamore, as he chooses. That is,
if the few sticks and feathers that line the hollow can be
called a nest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The courtship of the Owl begins late in March, for
Owls, living, as they do, permanently in their homes,
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
nest early; the <a id='horned1'></a>Great Horned Owl, of deservedly savage
reputation, beginning in February, and the round-faced
<a id='owlbar1'></a>Barred Owl in March. I have only seen the young Owls
on their first coming from the nest—queer, fuzzy little
balls, awkward in flight and noisy, who perch on a branch
like a row of clothes-pins all day, and then spend their
nights being fed, and in awkward attempts at learning to
fly. Once, in my girlhood, I kept an Owl with a sprained
wing in an outdoor cage for a couple of months, and he
grew quite tame and was very clever and clean apparently,
from the evidence of spilled water, taking a bath in his
pan every night and keeping his feathers in good
condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Major Bendire tells of the courtship of these songless
birds in a way that proves that where voice is lacking,
gesture takes the place of speech, as with Grackles and
Crows. ‘The female was perched in a dark, leafy tree,
apparently oblivious of the presence of her mate, who
made frantic efforts to attract her attention through a
series of bowings, wing-raisings, and snapping of the beak.
These antics were continued for some time, varied by
hops from branch to branch near her, accompanied by
that forlorn, almost despairing, wink peculiar to this bird.
Once or twice I thought that I detected sounds of inward
groanings as he, beside himself at lack of success, sat in
utter dejection. At last the lady lowered her haughty
head, looked at and approached him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young Owls when first hatched are blind and
featherless, and are so ravenous that not only do their
parents feed them at night but also put away enough
food in the nest to last through the day as well, so you can
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
easily see how useful a family of these Owls would be
the neighbourhood of any farm.</p>

“Are any of these other Owls here useful?” asked Sarah,
who had been looking at the birds in the glass case while
Gray Lady talked. “This great big one with feather
horns looks as if he could eat a little lamb or a big rooster
if he tried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='horned2'></a>That is the Great Horned Owl,” said Gray Lady,
“and fortunately he is very uncommon here in New England,
for he is a cruel and wasteful bird, unsociable and
sulky, killing chickens, and even turkeys and geese, and
often merely eating the head of its victim and then killing
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
again; it is the worst of all the birds of prey, and no excuse
can be found for its behaviour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <a id='owlbar2'></a>Barred Owl on the shelf beside the Great Horned,
though having a smooth head, is sometimes mistaken for
the fierce Owl and shot for its sins. Aside from sometimes
killing birds, it is a useful Owl, eating mice, rabbits, red
squirrels, etc. This is a remote, lonely sort of an Owl,
with a dismal hoot, as one man described it: ‘Hoo-ooo-ooo-ho-ho-ho-too-too-to-to!’
sometimes interspersed by
a laugh and then a wail. I disturbed a young bird once,
causing one of its parents great uneasiness. It is impossible
to describe all the notes uttered by it at this time;
they were rendered in a subdued muttering and complaining
strain, parts of which sounded exactly like ‘old-fool,
old-fool, don’t do it, don’t do it!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are two other owls that are very useful; one is
found all through the United States, and the other is a
more southern species, found usually south of New
England. The first is the <a id='short'></a>Short-eared or Marsh Owl, and
the other is the Barn Owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All Owls, in a way, look very much alike, in spite of
difference in colour and size. They have round, feathered
heads, which they are obliged to turn around when they
wish to look, as their eyes are so fixed in their sockets
that they cannot roll them as other birds and animals do;
some have feather horns and some do not. They all have
talons, either covered by scales or feathers, with which
they seize their food, which they swallow whole. But
between the <a id='barn1'></a>Barn Owl and his kin, the Horned, Hoot,
and Screech Owls, there is a striking contrast.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i205.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0016' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'></span>BARN OWL</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at those two in the case; they have round faces
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
and circles of feathers about the eyes. The Barn Owl has
a heart-shaped face-disk, about which the head-feathers
cluster, making the bird look like a funny old lady in a
cap. This is the Owl that is usually described in poetry—the
Church Tower Owl, the Monkey-faced Owl, etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While you look at this bird listen to some of the things
that the Wise Men say of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Barn Owl, strictly speaking, makes no nest. If
occupying a natural cavity of a tree, the eggs are placed
on the rubbish that may have accumulated at the bottom;
if in a bank, they are laid on the bare ground and among
the pellets of fur and small bones ejected by the parents.
Frequently, quite a lot of such material is found in their
burrows, the eggs lying on, and among, the refuse. Incubation
usually commences with the first egg laid, and
lasts about three weeks. The eggs are almost invariably
found in different stages of development, and downy
young may be found in the same nest with fresh eggs.
Both sexes assist in incubation. One of the best methods
of studying the food habits of Owls is to gather the pellets
which they disgorge. These consist of the undigested
refuse of their food, hair, bones, feathers, etc. Sometimes
enormous quantities of this refuse are found in the nesting-place
of the Barn Owl, one recorded instance being two or
three cubic feet. When the tired farmer is buried deep
in slumber, and nature is repairing the waste of wearied
muscles, this night-flying bird commences its beneficial
work, which ceases only at the rising of the sun. All that
has been written regarding the food of the Barn Owl
shows it to be of inestimable value to agriculture. Major
Bendire says: ‘Looked at from an economic standpoint,
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
it would be difficult to point out a more useful bird than
this Owl, and it deserves the fullest protection; but, as is
too often the case, man, who should be its best friend, is
generally the worst enemy it has to contend with, and it is
ruthlessly destroyed by him, partly on account of its odd
appearance and finely coloured plumage, but oftener
from the erroneous belief that it destroys the farmer’s
poultry.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the West, the food of the Barn Owl consists very
largely of pouched gophers, a specially destructive mammal,
also ground-squirrels, rabbits, and insects. In
the southern states large numbers of cotton rats are
destroyed, a fact which should be appreciated by every
planter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you see, children, that those farmers who live within
the range of the Barn Owl can not only safely let it nest
under their roofs, but give the barn mice into its keeping,
for it will do more good and less harm than the usual
prowling cat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Short-eared Owl is unlike his brethren in that
his nest, lined with a few feathers or grass, is in a hollow
in the ground or in a bunch of tall weeds or grasses. He
is also what is called a cosmopolitan Owl, which means
that he is equally at home in all parts of the country,
and, during the migrations and in the winter, these Owls
sometimes live in flocks of one hundred or more, which,
considering the usual solitary habits of Owls, is something
to remember particularly.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i208.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0017' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>SHORT-EARED OWL</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“As its nest is in moist, grassy meadows, so also does it
spend much of its time in the open, shunning the deep
woods beloved of other Owls, while it flies freely by day,
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
except in the brightest weather. On cloudy days it
flies low over the meadows, in which it searches carefully
for its food. On the wing, it is easy and graceful, its flight
being more like that of a Hawk than the heavy swoop of
the Owl. Its wings are long in proportion to its body,
which makes it appear very large when in flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Short-eared Owls delight in carrying their food to
a hayrick or some such object, where they eat it at leisure.
This same food of the Short-eared Owl, in itself, is a letter
of recommendation,—for it consists of meadow-mice,
gophers, and shrews (that are such a nuisance in the West),
grasshoppers, insects, and occasionally a bird,—so that,
like the Barn Owl and the Long-eared or Cat Owl, his
brother, this bird deserves full protection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another cause has done many an owl to death,—not his
‘fatal gift of beauty,’ that has made so many birds become
bonnet martyrs, but the fact that the Owl looks so wise that
he was supposed to be the favourite bird of Minerva, the
goddess of wisdom. For this reason, people like to have
stuffed Owls in their libraries to sit and look wise on a
bookcase top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus many of the birds that have escaped the farmers
have been shot by collectors for the taxidermists or bird-store
folk. Now the Wise Men are making laws which will,
we hope, protect the useful birds of prey from this fate as
they do the beautiful songsters; but it is not enough to
make laws, it is the business of each one of us to see that
they are carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a very amusing poem about an Owl in my
scrap-book. When you have read it, you may guess, if
you can, to which Owl the author refers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A very handsome bird, though somewhat of a cannibal;
the Wise Men wish him protected for the following
reasons:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When in doubt regarding the identity of a small
Hawk, give the benefit of the doubt to the Hawk, and
refrain from killing it, for you may thus spare a valuable
bird, belonging to a species that during every twelve
months renders service to the agricultural industry of
the country that is far beyond computation, but if
measured in dollars and cents would reach to very high
figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This appeal for protection of the Sparrow Hawks,
and the statements as to their value, would be worthless
if they could not be supported by <span class='it'>facts</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
“Dr. Fisher summarizes as follows: ‘The subject of
this Hawk is one of great interest, and, considered in its
economic bearings, is one that should be carefully studied.
The Sparrow Hawk is almost exclusively insectivorous,
except when insect food is difficult to obtain. In localities
where grasshoppers and crickets are abundant, these
Hawks congregate, often in moderate-sized flocks, and
gorge themselves continuously. Rarely do they touch
any other form of food until, either by advancing season
or other natural causes, the grasshopper crop is so lessened
that their hunger cannot be appeased without undue
exertion. Then other kinds of insects and other forms
of life contribute to their fare, and beetles, spiders, mice,
shrews, small snakes, lizards, or even birds may be required
to bring up the balance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘In some places in the West and South, telegraph poles
pass for miles through treeless plains and savannas.
For lack of better perches, the Sparrow Hawks often use
these poles for resting-places, from which they make
short trips to pick up a grasshopper or mouse, which they
carry back to their perch. At times, when grasshoppers
are abundant, such a line of poles is pretty well occupied
by these Hawks. In the vicinity of Washington, D.C.,
remarkable as it may appear to those who have not
interested themselves specially in the matter, it is the
exception not to find grasshoppers or crickets in the
stomachs of the Sparrow hawks, even when killed during
the months of January and February, unless the ground
is covered with snow. It is wonderful how the birds
can discover the half-concealed, semi-dormant insects,
which in colour so closely resemble the ground or dry
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
grass. Whether they are attracted by a slight movement,
or distinguish the form of their prey as it sits
motionless, is difficult to prove, but, in any case, the
acuteness of their vision is of a character which we are
unable to appreciate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘In the spring, when new ground or meadow is broken
by the plough, they often become very tame if not
molested. They fly down, even alighting under the very
horses, for an instant, in their endeavour to capture an
unearthed mouse or insect.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t there any <span class='it'>bad</span> Hawks, then?” asked little
Bobby, incredulously, for to him the cry of “Hawk!”
and the sight of the hired man with the gun came together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Bobby, plenty of them, even hereabouts; the
Sharp-shinned and the Chicken or Cooper’s Hawk, both
of them flash out of the sky and pounce cruelly on both
game- and song-birds. And, let me tell you all something,
though I do not wish to kill any birds needlessly, yet
I would not let any of these Hawks, useful or otherwise,
nest or feed near Birdland, and I should have Jacob
frighten them away with blank cartridges, because the
very sight of them terrifies the beautiful song-birds that
we love, and that trust us and confide in our protection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time November came in but few birds were to
be seen about the schoolhouse at Foxes Corners. For
until Gray Lady came, no one had taken an interest
either in the appearance of the schoolbuilding itself or
the ragged bit of ground upon which it stood. Now
four sugar-maples had been transplanted from the near-by
woods, and set where they would shade the windows in
the warm days of early summer and fall and yet not
interfere with winter sunshine; and Gray Lady had
promised that by spring there should be some benches
along the north fence, where there was shade from the
white birches in the wood-lot beyond. That is, she had
promised the wood for the benches and Jacob’s aid in
their planning; for the rest, the boys were to do the work
themselves, for after Thanksgiving four or five large boys
would come to school,—Tommy Todd’s brother Everett,
who was sixteen, and the two Judds, his cousins,—Walter,
also sixteen, and Irving, fourteen,—being among them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All of these boys knew something about the handling
of tools, and, if they chose to join the Kind Hearts’ Club,
would be valuable allies. Sometimes, however, big
boys, even though they are not cruel, laugh at such
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
societies, and so Gray Lady had made up her mind to let
them ask to come to the class in the workroom as if it was
a privilege they desired rather than as a favour to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One bit of carpentry she asked Jacob to undertake,
that no time should be lost, and that was the bird lunch-counter
for the school grounds. As the flagpole was
fastened to the schoolhouse, Jacob had utilized the gnarled
stump of a half-dead wild-apple tree, the bark of which
was seamed and scarred by the initials cut on it by many
generations of scholars. Above the platform, to hold
the crumbs and grain, he had fastened, between the two
remaining branches, a slanting roof made of some old
mossy shingles, and at the edge of this he had stuck half
a dozen crooked spikes to hold bacon rind or suet or
anything, like chicken bones, that might be left from the
dinner-pails, as many of the children, owing to distance
from home, always brought their lunch to school during
the winter and spring terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This lunch-counter was in place when Gray Lady went
to the school the first Friday afternoon in November,
and she brought an additional surprise with her,—two
pictures or charts that could be unrolled and hung on the
wall like the great map.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> Each of these charts held
the pictures of some twenty-five birds done in colours and
of natural size, and with each there was a little book
telling about the birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The charts were to be lent to the five other schools
in the township in turn, but the children at Foxes Corners
were so delighted with them that they resolved that the
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
first money that the Kind Hearts’ Club earned should
go to buy other pairs of the charts, so that they could
not only have some for their very own, but that the
other schools, who had no Gray Lady for their fairy god-mother,
could have them also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the first few weeks, Gray Lady found that it
would be best, on the Fridays when she visited the school,
simply to read to the children stories of the birds that
they had either seen at Birdland or that they already
knew by sight, from various books and magazines; as
she had at her house so many books, pictures of birds,
and the mounted birds themselves, that it was much
easier for them to name unknown birds there than at
school.</p>

<hr class='tbk106'/>

<p class='pindent'>“The singing-birds have all gone,” said Sarah Barnes,
the second Saturday of November, as she went to work
upon the last piece of her doll’s outfit—the cloak for
the Red Riding-Hood that she was dressing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We still have a Song Sparrow down in the meadow,”
said Goldilocks, “and there are plenty of Bluebirds
and Robins about, and Grackles and Cowbirds, but the
Song Sparrow is the only one that pretends to sing a nice
little song.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess we’ll have to go ahead to the spring birds or
there won’t be anything to learn about until they come
back,” chimed in Eliza Clausen, who was at work on
a doll baby, and as her fingers were long and slender,
she succeeded in hemming the fine lawn, of which the
dress was made, very nicely.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
“No birds?” said Gray Lady, raising her eyebrows.
“Open the window nearest you, Sarah, and do both you
and Eliza look out and listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see anything, and I only hear different kinds
of squeaks,” said Eliza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear the squeaks,” said Sarah, “but I see a gray bird
out here on the roof, with black on top of his head and
white underneath, and he’s got a long beak and a short
tail. Why, he’s just stuffed something that he had in
his beak in between the shingles. Now he’s crying
‘quank-quank’ and flying toward the orchard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='nut1'></a>“That,” said Gray Lady, “is the White-breasted
Nuthatch, one of our best winter friends, for though he
summers with us, like the Chickadee and the Woodpeckers,
it is not until the other birds have gone, and
the trees are bare of leaves, that we really seem to see
and appreciate him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Nuthatch is one of the tree-trunk birds that you
will learn to know so well, before winter is over, that
you will never forget them; for, though they have no
song to speak of, their cleverness and the good they do
when other birds have gone more than make up for
lack of music.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by tree-trunk birds?” asked
Clary; “I thought that birds liked leafy branches the
best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most birds do prefer the leafy branches,” said Gray
Lady; “that is why I call this little group, who do not,
‘tree-trunk birds,’ for all their little lives are spent so
close to the heart of the wood that they seem almost to
be parts of the tree.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='credit'>R. H. Beebe, Photo.</p> <p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>WHITE-BREASTED NUTHATCH</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
“These birds not only make their nests in the wood
itself by hollowing out partly decayed places in branch
and trunk, but they gain the greater part of their food
by searching the cracks in the tree bark for insects that
live there, and which other birds, that spend their lives
among the leafy twigs, cannot find.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This quarrying food from the bark makes it possible
for them to stay about the vicinity of their nesting-haunts
all winter; for many forms of insect life winter in the
bark crevices of forest as well as fruit trees where the
eggs hatch out, and the larvae undergo transformation
early in the season and begin to do mischief before the
migrant birds return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it were not for sleet storms, that cover the tree
with a coating of ice for days at a time, these hardy,
sociable little birds would be sure of a good living in
a neighbourhood like this, with many orchards and
strips of woodland. But when ice puts a lock on the
pantry doors, what can the poor birds do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Owing to their frail structure and warm blood, they
require more constant fuel to keep the life-fire alive than
the four-footed animals, so that when hunger and cold
travel hand in hand, they have to make a brave fight
for life. For generations this freezing up has happened
to them, and so, by experience, they have learned when
food is plenty to try and save it up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Nuthatch, that Sarah has just seen stowing
something away under the shingles, is living very well
at present. In spite of hard frost, wild food is plentiful;
then, too, the lunch-counter is amply supplied with
suet. The birds do not really need help as yet, but we
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
put the food there so that they may know where to find
it when hard times come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think the lunch-counter, with lots of easy
food, would make the birds lazy so’s they wouldn’t work
for a living,” said Dave. “Pop says, feeding tramps
everywhere only makes more folks turn tramp, so now
he can’t get anybody to work at haying or wood-cutting
for food and fair pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but that shows the difference between wild
birds and what is called ‘civilized’ man,” said Gray Lady.
“The Nuthatches do not sit still and gorge themselves,
but are busy providing for the future. Yesterday, I
saw one of these same birds packing away little bits of
suet in a crevice under the roof of the side porch, and
another using the thatch on the summer-house for a
larder. So it would seem that they distribute the food
in different places. If one cupboard is frozen up, one
of the others may be in the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pair of Nuthatches found that the cornice of the
main roof, under the tin gutter, was in poor shape, and
kindly called my attention to it by boring into the wood
and nesting in the space within. Five little birds were
hatched, and I believe that the party of seven, that are
so tame and come about the house so freely, are the birds
hatched in the cornice and their parents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t think that you would like them to
make holes in the house,” said Tommy, “for the water
might get in and do lots of harm, just the same as
Woodpeckers that make holes in the trees and spoil
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is where people make a mistake about these
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
tree-trunk birds that bore holes, and think that they
are mischievous and destructive, whereas they never
pierce bark unless an insect lurks beneath, and when
they bore a nest-hole in a tree, it is the same as saying
to its owner, ‘See, this wood is dead; I am making use
of what is otherwise useless to you and I will pay you
rent by protecting your other trees from harm. If you
watch well, you will see how many hairy caterpillars,
birch-lice, and wood-boring beetles I will kill in the
year.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The gutter is all mended and painted now, so the
Nuthatches can’t nest there next season, and I guess
they will be very sorry,” said Clary, who had taken her
turn at looking out the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the cornice has been mended, but Jacob has
hollowed out a bit of hickory branch with the bark on
it, and has fastened it firmly under the cornice with
screws, so that when the birds look up their home in
spring, they will find a new one so close to the old place
that I hope they will move into it. In fact, those pictures
in the workroom, of bird-homes made of hollowed-out
logs, were designed especially to attract these tree-trunk
birds and their little companions, <a id='cdee2'></a>the Chickadees, who,
though they search the twigs for food, love the trunk
also, and nest in a wood hollow like the Woodpeckers,
themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s come back again, but he hasn’t brought suet
this time; it’s some kind of a big seed that won’t stay
in the shingle crack, so he’s pounding it in,” said Sarah,
looking over Clary’s shoulder and dropping her sewing,
so interested was she in the movements of the bird.
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
“There, he’s going away and walking down the roof
head first; I don’t see why he doesn’t slip and fall, the
same as I did once when I tried to walk down the back
stairs on my hands and knees head first, ’cause brother
dared me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady hurried to the window in time to see the
Nuthatch give a final pound to the object that was
wedged between the shingles. With her opera-glasses,
she discovered that it was the empty shell of a beechnut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This little bird has been kind enough to write the
meaning of its singular name here on the roof, evidently
for the benefit of the Kind Hearts’ Club, for I have been
expecting that some of you would ask from what the
term ‘Nuthatch’ came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought it was a funny name, but then lots of
birds’ names seem queer, until you hear about them,”
said Eliza Clausen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This bird is very fond of nuts,” continued Gray
Lady, “not the very hard ones like butternuts, but the
smaller acorns, chestnuts, and especially the little three-cornered
beechnuts, with the sweet meat. Having no
teeth to crack them like a squirrel, and not being able
to use his beak for a nutcracker, he wedges the nut fast
and then uses his sharp, strong bill for a hatchet and
hatches the nut open; by this he has earned his name,
‘Nuthatch.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is another name that Goldilocks once gave
him that is quite as good, and that would remind you of
him wherever you hear it,—the ‘Upside-down’ bird!—for
what other bird that you know can climb about as
he does?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
“Woodpeckers do,” cried Tommy and Dave, together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and there’s another bird, little and brown and
striped, that’s only here in winter and goes up and down
all over the tree-trunks. I saw one this morning when
I was coming up,” said Sarah, “and I guess Chickadees
can go upside down, too, for I saw one hanging on to
a fir cone yesterday, and it was head down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady laughed. <a id='nut2'></a>“You all doubtless <span class='it'>think</span> that
all these other birds climb like the Nuthatch, but this
is a case of wrong seeing, which is simply another form
of not really paying attention; for not one of them
walks upside down in the same way. Hear what one of
our poets says of this:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Even the woodpeckers, supplied, as they are, with a reversed
toe and a stiff, supporting tail, cannot compete with the Nuthatches
in descending head first. The Woodpecker, in going down
the trunk, finds itself in the same predicament as the bear,—its
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
climbing tools work only one way. It is dependent on its
stiff tail for support, and so must needs hop down backwards.
The Creeper is still more hidebound in its habits, and its motto
seems to be “Excelsior.” It begins at the foot of its ladder, and
climbs ever upwards. But the climbing ability of the Nuthatch
is unlimited. It circles round the branches, or moves up, down,
and around the trunks, apparently oblivious to the law of gravitation.
Its readiness in descending topsyturvy is due, in part,
to the fact that, as the quills of its tail are not stiff enough to
afford support, it is obliged to depend upon its legs and feet.
As it has on each foot three toes in front and only one behind,
it reverses the position of one foot in going head downward,
throwing it out sidewise and backward, so that the three long
claws on the three front toes grip the bark and keep the bird from
falling forward. The other foot is thrown forward, and thus,
with feet far apart, the “little gymnast has a wide base beneath
him.” The Nuthatch not only straddles in going down the tree,
but spreads its legs widely in going around the trunk, but bird
artists generally seem to have overlooked this habit. The
slightly upturned bill of the Nuthatch, and its habit of hanging
upside down, give it an advantage when in the act of prying
off scales of bark, under which many noxious insects are secreted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='brown'></a>The little, brown-striped bird that Sarah saw this
morning, that somewhat resembles a Wren, is the <a id='bcreeper'></a>Brown
Creeper, for it creeps like a veritable feathered mouse.
Though it is a true tree-trunk bird, in that it lives and
nests as close to the heart of wood as possible, it has a
slender needle-like bill for picking out insects; but it cannot
bore wood with it, so it has to be content to make
its home between the wood and the bark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This bird comes to us in middle New England only
as a winter visitor, and well does it pay its way by eating
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
grubs and insect eggs. It does not seem very shy, hereabouts,
but in the nesting time it loves deep, silent forests
and the cedar swamps of the North, and it is only in these
places that its strange, sweet song may be heard, which
is something that I have never heard successfully imitated
or put into syllables, but Mr. Brewster, who is
one of the Wise Men who knows, says it is like the soft
sigh of the wind among the pine boughs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is in these deep woods, also, that it nests. Discovering
a tree where the bark is loose and yet does not strip
off too easily, this little Creeper finds a nook of the right
size, which he lines with soft bark, moss, or bits of wood
so thoroughly decayed that it is like sponge, and in this
bed are laid six or eight pretty little lavender eggs with
brown spots wreathed about the larger end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the Creeper comes to us, he has evidently forgotten
home and family cares as well as his beautiful
song, for he only favours us with a very scratchy squeak,
as if a file at work on a wire and a couple of crossed tree
branches were striving to see which could sing the better.
But he is as busy as busy can be, and acts as if he were
practising for a race in climbing the stairs of a lighthouse
tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the bottom of the tree, he starts and goes up and
around without a pause until he is two-thirds of the way
up and the more frequent branches bother him. Then
he stops a moment to rest, bracketing himself against
the tree by the sharp point of his tail-feathers, which
arrangement he possesses in common with the Chimney
Swift and the Woodpeckers. Next, without warning, he
flits with a backward tilt either to the base of another
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
tree, or to the same one, and again begins to climb; so for
him the Stair-climber would be a good name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He, also, when the trees are ice-plated, will come
gladly to the lunch-counter, I know, for as a girl, long
before I left home, this Creeper used to feed upon the
scraps that I put upon my window-ledge; for, though
people here have been feeding birds in winter this long
while, it has only been since the Wise Men have told us
of the particular needs of each bird family that we have
been able to do it intelligently, and to the best advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are some verses in my scrap-book about this
tree-trunk bird, also, and it seems as if our poets were
very fond of these songless birds who inspire them
as much by their friendliness as the others do by melody.
I hope that a couple of you will learn this to
recite at Christmas. As there are four verses, each can
learn two, and then alternate in repeating them.</p>

Gray Lady; <a id='woodp'></a>they’re Woodpeckers,” said little Bobby,
who seemed to have grown taller and broader ever since
the day that Jacob had put a jack-knife in his hand and
taught him to carve a wooden spoon, and he felt himself
to be a full-fledged boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some Woodpeckers are pretty bad, though, ’cause
grandpa caught a whole bunch of ’em early last spring
sucking the juice out of the apple trees in the young
orchard, and Uncle Bill, over the mountain, said they did
the same to his sugar-maples. I saw what they did,
myself, and you can see, too, if you stop up at our house
some time when you are passing, for the marks are there,—little
round holes, all in rows so as they make squares
like the peppery holey plasters grandma wears for a lame
back. They were awfully pretty birds, too—all red on
the head and neck, and black and white speckled on top,
and yellow underneath, and black across the front.
I had a good chance to see it, ’cause grandpop was hoppin’
mad and tried to shoot them, and he did get one of the
prettiest of them all. Some of them that were on the
apple tree didn’t have so many colours in their feathers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
“Perhaps those were females,” said Sarah Barnes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, <a id='sap1'></a>the paler ones are the females and lack the red
throat and sometimes the red head-feathers, also,” said
Gray Lady, “for this bird is called the Sapsucker, Yellow-bellied
Sapsucker, because it has, as Bobby has
told us, the bad habit of not only boring into trees for
insects, but sucking the sap as well, and when a number
of them are found together, of course, they are likely to
do harm. Still, to my mind, the very worst that they
do is to give a bad name to the family of the most
industrious insect-eating birds that we have.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even though this Sapsucker takes enough sap to
have earned his title, he keeps up the family record as
an insect eater, for he has a form of the pointed tongue
with hooked bristles on the end, like all Woodpeckers,
and this weapon acts both as a spear and trap to catch
insects. Then, too, the Sapsucker is not a permanent
resident, like many of his family, but nests early in the
most northerly states and travels about during a great
part of the year. As he can only suck sap during the
growing season, and eats insects the year around, besides
many wild berries—such as those of poison ivy, dogwood,
etc.—that are of no use to us, I think he should be forgiven
his sip of fresh spring sap, except where, as in the
case of Bobby’s grandfather, he is caught in the act of
hurting valuable trees.</p>

“How many kinds of Woodpeckers are there around
here?” asked Eliza Clausen. “I didn’t know there was
but one, the great big one, thick like a Pigeon, all speckled
black and brown on top, with a red spot on his head and
a big white spot over his tail. We had two down at our
farm this summer, and they lived in a hole in the old
wild cherry, and they laid real nice white eggs, just as
white as our Leghorns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’d you know they had white eggs?” asked Clary.
“You can’t see into a Woodpecker’s hole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I could reach in, though. I didn’t keep the egg,
and only looked at it, and one of the old birds bit me
something fierce. They’re real plucky birds, anyway,
whatever they are called, for nobody seems to give them
the same name. Mother says they are Pigeon Woodpeckers,
and Dad calls them Yallerhammers, and both
names fit pretty well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are half a dozen Woodpeckers to be found
here, but the one that Eliza has described and the little
black-and-white streaked Downy Woodpecker are the
most familiar as well as the most useful of them all.
As to Eliza’s <a id='flick'></a>Pigeon Woodpecker or Yellowhammer,
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
the poor bird is weighed down by over thirty popular
names,—Northern Flicker, Golden-winged Woodpecker,
Wake-up, Gaffer, and Partridge Woodpecker being
among them, though the Wise Men who settle these
things for us have decided to call him merely ‘the
Flicker.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In spite of the fact that, owing to his size and plumpness,
the Flicker has been until recently allowed to be
shot as a game-bird, he is our commonest Woodpecker,
and spring would not be the same in this woodland
region if we did not hear the roll of the drum, as he beats
on a branch, that announces the coming of the feathered
procession of migrants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, too, it is such a jolly bird, it calls out ‘wick,
wick, wick,’ as soon as the ponds are free of ice, and
this call he changes to ‘wicker-wicker’ as soon as the
courting begins; at this time the birds show to the best
advantage. The rival birds are perfectly friendly, but
‘they play curious antics, each trying to outdo the other
in the display of his golden beauty, that he may thus
attract and hold the attention of the female. There is
no fighting, but, in its place, an exhibition of all the airs
and graces that rival dandies can muster. Their extravagant,
comical gestures, rapidly changing attitudes,
and exuberant cries, all seem laughable to the onlooker,
but evidently give pleasure to the birds.’—<span class='sc'>Forbush.</span></p>

<img src='images/i234.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0021' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>FLICKER</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The Flicker spends more time on the ground, itself,
than the others of its family; and it has a slightly curved
beak, but its tongue is very long, and the fine points
on the end are set backward like the barbs of a fish-hook.
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
Its most valuable work is as an ant-eater, and as
one of the Wise Men says: ‘This bird is more of an ant-eater
than a Woodpecker. It may be seen in fields and
open spaces, in woods and orchards, where it strikes its
long bill into ant-hills, and then thrusts out its still longer
tongue coated with sticky saliva and licks up the out-rushing
ants by the dozen. Many kinds of ants are
decidedly harmful, as they attend, protect, and help to
spread plant-root, or bark-lice, which are among the
greatest enemies of garden plants, also shrubs and trees.
These lice the ants keep as cows to nourish their young
with green, sappy milk. Ants also infest houses and
destroy timber.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people complain that the Flicker bores holes
in the attics of houses, and also under eaves when searching
for nesting-places, and also for winter shelter. This
is true, doubtless, but as the Nuthatch told me that my
cornice was decayed and needed mending, so the working
of a Flicker about any building should be a warning
to the owner to look and see if repairs are not needed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our neighbour, Mr. Burwood, the florist, on the next
hill, who, in spite of the fact that he must keep his eyes
indoors on the splendid carnations and roses he grows,
still has a glance or two to spare for the birds, told me,
not long ago, this story of a Flicker. It was in early
spring, and he was thinking of turning the water into a
great covered tank, mounted on high trestles, that supplies
water for the houses, that had been empty all winter;
in fact, he had given the men orders so to do. Early in
the morning he heard a vigorous tapping high up in the
air, and tried in vain to locate it. The next morning, the
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
same sound came, when he traced it to a Flicker, hammering
away at one of the stout oaken staves of which
the tank was made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thinking that the bird was trying an impossible task,
he continued about his work, but, after the hammering
had continued for several days, his suspicions were aroused,
the tank was examined, and two holes were found,
drilled entirely through the stave, which, in spite of
appearances, was unsound and would, probably, have given
out without warning at some inconvenient season when
repairs would have cut off the water supply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always deal kindly with the Flicker, and never make
the mistake of confusing it with the Sapsucker; look for
the <span class='it'>white spot on the rump</span> and the <span class='it'>yellow wing-linings</span>, and
you will know it, and, though the young of the year lack
these marks at first, they have no yellow upon their
breasts that can excuse you for making a mistake.</p>

“Then, last and least in size, but chief in importance
among the tree-trunk birds, come the little <a id='downy'></a>Downy Woodpeckers,
only as big as the Tree-sparrow or Winter Chippy,
as it is called, plump, all neatly patterned in black and
white, a scarlet band on the back of the neck, while Mrs.
Downy and the children lack even this bit of colour.
You cannot mistake this Woodpecker for any other, for
his big brother the Hairy Woodpecker, who has somewhat
similar markings, is almost as big as a Robin, besides being
a more timid bird of the woods that does not come about
houses like the confiding and cheerful Downy. The Hairy
Woodpecker has a more harsh and screaming call-note
than the clear, sharp cry of the Downy. In watching
birds, you should remember to keep the ears open and
trained to hearing as well as the eye to seeing, as a bird that
keeps too far away for the sight may oftentimes be recognized
by its note.</p>

<p class='credit'>F. M. Chapman, Photo.</p> <p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>DOWNY WOODPECKER</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The Downy’s life is spent in the tree-trunks and
hollow limbs, where he merely chisels his doorway
large enough, but with not a bit to spare, and the
hole within is nicely finished with a few soft chips by
way of a bed for the eggs; nice white eggs like all the
Woodpeckers, and this would seem to prove that thrifty
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
Nature, knowing that the eggs would be hidden in the
dark nesting-hole, did not think it necessary to decorate
them for their better protection as she does the eggs laid
in open nests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To name the injurious insects, moths, and caterpillars
our little Downy eats would require a long list, but, as he
is a lover of orchards in spring and summer, we may
mention the apple-tree borer as one against whom he
wages war, and here, by his delicate sense of touch, he
locates the larvæ of the codling-moth. ‘Every stroke
with which he knocks at the door of an insect’s retreat
sounds the crack of doom. He pierces the bark with his
beak, then with his barbed tongue drags forth an insect,
and moves on to tap a last summons on the door of the
next in line.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boring beetles, bark beetles, weevils, caterpillars, ants,
and plant-lice, the imagoes of night-moths, as well as
the eggs of many insects, are also on his bill of fare.
Sometimes he has been accused of boring holes for
sap-sucking, but this is disproven; where a hole exists
it is because insect prey, in one of its many forms, hide
beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fortunately, we have many families of the little Downy
in the old orchard, and the fact that they are good patrons
of Goldilocks’ lunch-counter does not seem to make them
relax their vigilance about the apple trees, so that I
wonder if it may not be their care, together with the other
tree-trunk birds, to which we owe the keeping of the trees,
during the ten long years they have been neglected by
man. For, though the trees in Birdland are old, gnarled,
and vine-draped, yet they are neither worm-eaten nor
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
unsightly, but merely picturesque, and from the birds’ point
of view cosy and homelike.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Grouse, Quail, Woodcock, and the Wood Duck</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Saturday before Thanksgiving Tommy Todd came
trudging up the road toward “the General’s,” with an
extremely contented expression on a face that was usually
more than cheerful, while he kept turning his head to admire
something that he carried in his right hand, twisting and
swinging it as he walked. <a id='ruff1'></a>The something was a beautiful
male Ruffed Grouse, or Partridge, as it is commonly called,
in all the bravery of its glossy neck-ruff and tail that when
spread looks like that of a miniature Wild Turkey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together with the Grouse was a pair of Quail in rich,
brown autumn coats and snowy throats that excel those
of the White-throated Sparrow itself. Tommy’s father
and his elder brother Joe, the Fair Meadows blacksmith,
had taken two “days off,” and gone a-hunting up to the
upland brush-country beyond the river woods, and these
birds, a part of the result, were a gift for Gray Lady and
Goldilocks. Not only were the birds in fine condition,
but they were nicely tied together with some sprays of
trailing ground-pine and a little tuft of pungent wintergreen
with its coral berries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady took the birds, and as she thanked Tommy
for them, glanced toward Goldilocks, who sat in the
library window watching for the children to come. When
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
the young girl saw the birds, she gave an exclamation,
half of pleasure at their plumage, half of sorrow that
they were dead, for to keep everything alive and as happy
as possible was her inherent nature. But she knew that
these were game- or “chicken-birds,” as she had once called
them when a mere baby, whose fate was to be eaten, and
that Tommy’s father had only followed a legitimate desire
for outdoor life and its sports when he had tramped more
than thirty miles for the hunting. So she merely said, as
she smoothed the beautifully shaded feathers, “I wish
the Kind Hearts’ Club could do something to make game-birds
have a <span class='it'>very</span> comfortable, good time, the part of the
year when they are not hunted; do you think we could,
mother? For I don’t think that this shy kind of bird
will come to the lunch-counter, and I’ve been wondering
lately what they find to eat in such cold winters as the
last. Miss Wilde has told me that for weeks last winter
the snow was so deep that in going, from where she lived,
a mile to school, she never even saw a fence top, so if
game-birds ‘feed chiefly on the ground after the manner
of barnyard fowls, roosting in low trees and bushes,’ as
one of my books says, I do not see why they do not freeze
and starve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what Pop and Grand’ther and Joe were talking
about last night,” said Tommy; “they said that they
travelled over miles of stubble-fields and brush-lots where
there used to be lots of birds, and now, in spite of the laws
in our place that are down on pot-hunters and won’t let
game be sold or carried away, and our having a keen
county warden, the birds seem to be melting away just
the same.”</p>

<p class='credit'>Dr. C. K. Hodge, Photo.</p> <p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>RUFFED GROUSE</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
“What did your father think was the reason?” asked
Gray Lady, for she remembered as a young girl that the
General used to say, “Get a farmer interested in a subject
enough to make him really think, and you cannot get
better advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pop said all these new stiff-edged stone roads that are
pushing out the dirt and grass lanes may be mighty fine
for automobiles and all the other dust-raisers, but they’re
poor trash for horses’ feet and game-birds, ’cause the
brush along the old roads both sides of the fences made
good cover and kept the snow, when it drifted, sort of
loose, so that the birds could get in and out to look for
food. But when everything is trimmed smooth, the snow
lies flat and hard and crusty, and the birds can’t get under
to grub for food, and if they’re under and it freezes on top
of ’em, they can’t get out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grand’ther said that was so, but he reckoned there
wasn’t so much for the game-birds to eat, anyhow, because
folks that used to raise just so many acres of rye and
wheat and oats and buckwheat had mostly given it up
and put their land down to meadows for hay, because that
is the only crop that there is a sure market for everywhere.
Then Grand’ther said that, between freezing and
starving, and what was left being shot down close, it’s a
wonder there’s any Grouse left, or <a id='bobW2'></a>Bob-whites either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Goldilocks, you have your answer as to what
the Kind Hearts’ Club can do to make these food-birds
comfortable during the ten months of the year (in this state,
Connecticut), when they may roam without fear of hunting
by honest sportsmen. The dishonest hunters and pot-hunters,
who do not care for law and order, we must
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
watch and bring to justice, just as we do any other class
of criminals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some very good people are extremely careless about
this, and would arrest a hungry man for stealing a bottle
of milk from a doorstep, and yet even buy game from
poachers whom they knew had taken it against the law;
doing this is a far more serious offence, for one of our Wise
Men has said that wild birds are not the property of the
individual, but of the Commonwealth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish these birds need never be shot; don’t you?”
said Sarah Barnes. “They are much prettier than some
song-birds, and I’m sure that Bob-white’s call is just as
pleasant to hear as a song.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Sarah, I should like to protect the game-birds
also, unless in cases where people, living away from places
where other food can be had, are really hungry. But
there are two sides to this question, and the Kind Hearts’
Club must always try to look at both, so as to be sure that
in being just to one, the other may not be misjudged.
All over the country there are hundreds of men who, for
nearly all the year, are tied to desks in offices, and their
heads are weary and their bodies cramped. The love of
hunting is born in man, probably an inheritance from
his ancestors, who hunted for their living, just as the
bird inherits the instincts of migration from its parents
and performs the journeys even when there is no
need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This love of hunting leads the men out into the woods
for a few weeks, or even days, each year, and, besides the
hunting, they meet Nature face to face, and, whether they
know it or not, come back better able to take up the work
of life, which is a harder struggle as the world gets older

“Some people may not agree with me, but I had a good
warm-hearted father, who gave his life in the cause of
humanity; yet he loved fair hunting, and Goldilocks’ father
did, also. So I think that the Kind Hearts’ Club will not
only be doing the game-bird a service, but man also, if it
can make and carry out a plan to feed and shelter these
birds, even in the space of Fair Meadows township.</p>

tame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They make their nest on the ground, Dave,” said Gray
Lady; “not much of a nest, merely a few leaves scratched
together in a tree hollow. Now we have these real birds
here (for later I know that Tommy will let me share them
with Miss Wilde’s mother, who has been so ill, and her
appetite needs tempting), let us spend the morning with
the game-birds; Dave shall tell us of his Woodcock’s nest,
and I have many little bits in the scrap-book about the
others, besides remembrances of my own.</p>

“I will read you his story, written by a Wise Man of
Massachusetts who knows the game-birds from all sides.”</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“The Ruffed Grouse, the ‘King of American game-birds,’
was abundant in all our woods, and was often seen in
fields and orchards, until its numbers were decimated by
the gunner and the survivors driven to the cover of the
pines. The characteristic startling roar of its wings,
with which it starts away when flushed from the ground,
and its habit of drumming on a log, have been often
described. The speed with which the wings are beaten
in drumming makes it impossible for the human eye to
follow them and make sure whether they strike anything
or not. Naturalists, after long discussion, had come to believe
that the so-called ‘drumming,’ of the Ruffed Grouse
was caused by the bird beating the air with its wings,
as described by Mr. William Brewster; but now comes
Dr. C. F. Hodge and reopens the controversy by exhibiting
a series of photographs, which seem to show that the
bird, in drumming, strikes the contour feathers of the body.
Strange as it may seem, there are many people who often
take outings in the country, yet have never heard the
drumming of this bird. This tattoo is most common in
late winter and early spring, but may be heard occasionally
in summer and not uncommonly in fall. While
sounded oftenest during the day, it may fall on the ear at
any hour of the night. In making it, the bird usually
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
stands very erect on a hollow log or stump, with head
held high and ruffs erected and spread, and, raising its
wings, strikes downward and forward. The sound produced
is a muffled boom or thump. It begins with a few
slow beats, growing gradually quicker, and ends in a
rolling, accelerated tattoo. It has a ventriloquial property.
Sometimes, when one is very close to the bird, the drumming
seems almost soundless; at other times it sounds
much louder at a distance, as if, through some principle
of acoustics, it were most distinctly audible at a certain
radius from the bird. It is the bird’s best expression of
its abounding vigour and virility, and signifies that the
drummer is ready for love or war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The female alone understands the task of incubation
and the care of the young. Once, however, when I came
upon a young brood, the agonized cry of the distressed
mother attracted a fine cock bird. He raised all his
feathers and, with ruffs and tail spread, strutted up to
within a rod of my position, seemingly almost as much
concerned as the female, but not coming quite so near.
The hen sometimes struts forward toward the intruder in
a similar manner, when surprised while with her young.
She can raise her ruffs and strut exactly like the cock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Grouse has so many enemies that it seems remarkable
how it can escape them, nesting as it does on the
ground. Instances are on record, however, where birds,
that probably have been much persecuted, have learned
to deposit their eggs in old nests of Hawks or Crows, in
tall trees. Whenever the mother bird leaves the nest, the
eggs are easily seen, and, while she sits, it would seem
impossible for her whereabouts to remain a secret to the
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
keen-scented prowlers of the woods. But her colours
blend so perfectly with those of the dead leaves on the
forest floor, and she sits so closely, and remains so motionless
among the shadows, that she escapes the sharp-eyed
Hawk. She gives out so little scent that the dog, skunk,
or fox passes quite near, unnoticing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Grouse does not naturally fear man; more than
once, in the wilderness of the northwest, a single bird has
walked up to within a few feet of me. They will sit on
limbs just above one’s head, almost within reach, and
regard one curiously, but without much alarm. Usually,
in Massachusetts, when a human being comes near the
nest, the mother bird whirs loudly away. She has well
learned the fear of man; but, in a place where no shooting
was permitted, a large gang of men were cutting under-brush,
while a Partridge, sitting there, remained quietly
on her nest as the men worked noisily all about her.
Another bird, that nested beside a woods road, along which
I walked daily, at first would fly before I had come within
a rod of her; but later she became confiding enough to
sit on her nest while six persons passed close beside her.
Evidently the bird’s facility in concealing her nest consists
in sitting close and keeping her eggs well covered. Her
apparent faith in her invisibility is overcome only by her
fear of man or her dread of the fox. When the fox is seen
approaching directly toward her, she bristles up and flies
at him, in the attempt to frighten him with the sudden
roar of her wings and the impetuosity of her attack; but
Reynard, although at first taken aback, cannot always be
deceived by such tricks; and the poor bird, in her anxiety
to defend her nest, only betrays its whereabouts. Probably,
however, the fox rarely finds her nest, unless he
happens to blunder directly into it.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
“During the fall the Grouse keep together in small
flocks. Sometimes a dozen birds may be found around
some favourite grape-vine or apple tree, but they are
usually so harried and scattered by gunners that toward
winter the old birds may sometimes be found alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As winter approaches, this hardy bird puts on its
‘snow-shoes,’ which consist of a fringe of horny processes
or pectinations that grow out along each toe, and help
to distribute the weight of the bird over a larger surface,
and so allow it to walk over snows into which a bird not
so provided would sink deeply. Its digestion must resemble
that of the famous Ostrich, as broken twigs and
dry leaves are ground up in its mill. It is a hard winter
that will starve the Grouse. A pair spent many winter
nights in a little cave in the rocky walls of an old quarry.
Sumacs grew there and many rank weeds. The birds
lived well on sumac berries, weed seeds, and buds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes, but perhaps rarely, these birds are imprisoned
under the snow by the icy crust which forms in cold
weather following a rain, but usually they are vigorous
enough to find a way out, somewhere. The Grouse is perfectly
at home beneath the snow; it will dive into it to
escape a Hawk, and can move rapidly about beneath the
surface and burst out again in rapid flight at some unexpected
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Ruffed Grouse is a bird of the woodland, and
though useful in the woods, it sometimes does some injury
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
in the orchard, by removing too many buds from a single
tree. In winter and early spring, when other food is
buried by the snow, and hard to obtain, the Grouse lives
largely on the buds and green twigs of trees; but, as spring
advances, insects form a considerable part of the food.
The young feed very largely on insects, including many
very destructive species.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You all know the path that runs by the grist-mill
and up through the river woods. In spring, I could
almost count upon seeing a Grouse or two when I took
that walk, and very early, of September and October
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
mornings, I have seen the <a id='cock2'></a>Woodcock probing, with their
long, sensitive, pointed bills, with which they can feel
like fingers, in the muddy ground back of the river woods
for the worms, and such like, upon which they feed. It
was my father, himself, who took me one evening, even
though it was bedtime, to these same woods to hear the
Woodcock’s courting dance and song.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know any game-birds could sing,” said
Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are not classed with song-birds, and yet in courting
time, most birds have some sort of musical speech in
addition to their call-notes; you know that even Crows
sometimes succeed in singing. But this love-song varies
with the individual bird more than it does with the birds
that are real vocalists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Woodcock feed chiefly at dawn and twilight,
and it is easy to tell where they have been by the little
holes in the mud left by the bill. This spring night
father took me to the wood edge, and drew me to him, to
keep me still while we waited—for what? I was soon to
know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Presently a half-musical cry came out of the gathering
darkness, and was repeated and echoed by several
others. Then a rush, as if a bird had flung himself into
the air and opened his wings at the same time; next, a
whirring sound as the bird circled skyward and vanished,
his notes falling behind him, but before I realized what
was going on, the bird dropped straight as a Hawk,
balanced on his toes, gave a low, musical cry, and began
again; for thus it is that the Woodcock tries to please
and win his mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dave, please tell us about the bird that you saw on
the nest,” said Gray Lady, “and how you came to find it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half a dozen of us went out to hunt for May-flowers
(Trailing Arbutus) one Wednesday along the first part of
April last year. Miss Wilde thought Zella had measles,
and school was closed two days, but doctor found it
was only a cold and eating too much sausage meat and
sweet pickles, and so they broke out, and he gave her
rhubarb.” (Dave, having been asked to tell all about it,
was bound to omit no detail.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The others of our crowd stayed along by the path that
runs through the wood, where you saw the birds dance,
because there are black snakes through the brush there
that begin to crawl out to sun in April, and the girls were
scared of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went on ahead a little piece, and turned up a side hill
where there was an old rail fence that divides our woods
from the Cobbs’ piece. Right in front of me I found a
bully patch of May-flowers, and I sat down and began
cutting them with my knife (’cause they have wiry sort
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
of stems) and made them in a nice even bunch, when
something ahead sort of made me keep my eyes glued to
it. It was under the slant of the lowest fence rail. I
thought it was a striped snake curled up round, at first,
because I felt eyes were looking at me, though it was
too dark to see them, at first. Did you ever have that
feeling, Gray Lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have had it, Dave, and I know what a strange
sensation it is. The last time I had it I felt no better
when I saw the eyes; in fact, little cold shivers went all
over, for I was far away from here, and the eyes were
those of a rattlesnake that was coiled up, amid the stones
of a ledge, where I was gathering some rare wild flowers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what <span class='it'>did</span> you do?” cried all the children, together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I backed away as fast as I could, keeping my eyes
upon the snake, until I was at a safe distance, where he
could not spring at me, and then I very foolishly ran!
What did you do, Dave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I crept up nearer until I got a good look, and then I
saw that it was a bird. It was sitting ever so still, with
its head well down on its shoulders and its long beak
close to its breast. It had queer, big eyes set up on top
of its head, and round like a frog’s, not like any other
bird that I know of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The eyes of the Woodcock and its cousins, the Snipe,
are set in this way, so that, when they are boring in the
 mud for food, they can keep watch behind them as well
as in front,” said Gray Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First, I thought the bird was dead, it kept so still,”
continued Dave, “but I could see its breast raised a little
with its breathing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
“If it had been dead, its eyes would have been closed,”
said Gray Lady. “It is one of the many mysterious and
unaccountable facts about a bird, that it is the only
animal that closes its own eyes when death touches it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t afraid, so I thought that I would just smooth
its feathers,” said Dave. “I did, and it didn’t fly, only
just puffed up a little, so I thought I would lift it very
carefully to see if there were any eggs under it, and there
were four nice, sort of round, light, brown eggs, the
colour that our Plymouth Rocks lay, only mottled. But the
bird didn’t like to be lifted, and she sort of growled inside,
the way a hen does, so I set her down and went away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a very pleasant experience of yours, Dave,
and shows how tame game-birds will become if they are
kindly treated. This Woodcock has an advantage over
the Grouse and Bob-white, his cousin, because it travels
South in winter and constantly shifts its feeding-places,
but it suffers from other dangers: it is hunted in all the
states through which it passes, and the eggs are large
enough to be very attractive, not only to foxes and all
the gnawing creatures of the woods, but to people as
well. If that nest and eggs had been seen by one of those
foreign-born poachers who come here thinking that everything
they find out-of-doors, and they can pocket, belongs
to them, the poor Woodcock would have lost her entire
brood and perhaps her own life as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These three land-birds, together with a number of
wild ducks, that live some on fresh and some near salt
water, travelling North and South according to season,
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
are the legitimate game-birds of the country. Of the
wild ducks, the most of these breed in the far North, and
are hunted in their migrations. If this hunting is done
fairly, as the law prescribes, and the birds are not chased
and shot at from moving boats, or with repeating guns,
or when startled from their sleep with flashing lights,
they seem able to hold their own. Humanity, however,
demands that they should not be hunted on
their spring journeys on the way to their nesting-haunts
and when they may have already chosen mates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='duck'></a>One Duck there is, however, of exquisite plumage,
gentle disposition, and quiet, domestic habits, nesting
about inland ponds and streams, in the inhabited parts
of the United States, from Florida up to Hudson Bay,
that is in danger of swift extinction if the protection given
song-birds is not extended to it. This is the Wood Duck,
called in Latin ‘<span class='it'>Aix Sponsa</span>’—‘Bridal Duck’—from the
fact that the beauty of his plumage was fit for a bridal
garment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at that bird, mounted on a mossy stump, in that
case by the window. When I was a girl, I have seen a
half-dozen pairs in the pond above the grist-mill, and I
knew as surely where I could always find a pair nesting
as where I could find a Robin or Song Sparrow, but now
it is fast becoming a bird of the past, only to be seen in
pictures. Why is this? The reasons are many, and some,
such as the settlement of the country, and the draining
of ponds and waterways, and the cutting down of river
brush, cannot be helped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Wood Duck nests in a tree hole, and, when the
young are able to leave the nest, the parents hold them in
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
their bills and carry them to the ground in somewhat the
way in which cats remove their kittens from place to place.
Consequently, if the lumber is cleared, and no suitable
trees are left, what is this Duck to do? He cannot take to
the chimneys as the Swifts have. Still, this Duck, whose
beauty alone is a sufficient and patriotic reason for saving
him to his country, might adapt his nesting to other conditions
if it could be protected as the Grouse, Quail, and
Woodcock are in New England, or, better yet, not be
hunted in any way for a number of years, so that the
Wood Ducks, wherever located, should have, a chance to
increase once more and reëstablish themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For, when we come to look closely at the matter, there is
really no fair hunting, for the killing inventions of man—the
magazine guns, etc.,—are on the increase, while the
power of poor game-birds to protect themselves lessens both
on land and water. Think of it, in some states there are no
laws to protect this bird, even in summer, and, as Wood
Ducks are fond of their nesting-places, and are very
unsuspicious birds, it often happens that an entire family
is killed the moment the young are large enough to furnish
the pitiful thing, in this case, that is called ‘sport.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As it happens, the woods on this side of the river from
above the pond to the sawmill belong to the General’s
farm, and, Tommy and Dave, the water right on the other
side belongs to your fathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you not ask them if they will help me to protect
their birds, if I can get half a dozen pairs from one of the
Wise Men who is trying to reëstablish them in their old
haunts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Grouse and Quail are growing friendly again under
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
protection, and I am in hopes that we may have a drummer,
as well as a fifer and his family, in the orchard and
near-by woods next spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are many hollow willows near the upper pond
like the ones in which the Wood Ducks used to nest.
If these are left, the ducks will soon become attached to
them, and, if they escape peril elsewhere, for this Duck’s
greatest danger is in the vicinity of home, then we shall
all have a chance, possibly, some day to see a sight that
ever the Wise Men argue about,—the parent Duck bringing
her young from the tree hole to take their first swim!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys promised to ask the question, and Tommy reported
at the schoolhouse, the next Friday, that “grandpa
thinks it would be just bully to have Wood Ducks again,
and he’ll sit round the pond, with a shot-gun, all he’s
able, to keep folks away. He says he’s seen the old ones
yank the young, one by one, right out of the nest by the
wing, and set ’em on the ground, and when they were all
down, lead ’em to the water. And once, when the tree was
close over the pond, the old bird flew down and set ’em
right on the water. He says weasels and water-rats and
snakes and snapping-turtles help kill off the ducklings, because
until they get big enough to fly they’ve got no way
of lighting-out.” All of which goes to prove that Tommy
Todd had inherited some of his keenness of eye in “watching
out” for the doings of wild things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are others that are classed with game-birds that
will surely everywhere be stricken from the list some day,
and put with those birds that we wish to cherish at all
seasons, and for whom there should be no hunting, either
fair or foul.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
“These birds, even though a couple of them are cousins
to the Woodcock, are so small of body (their long wing
in flight giving a deceptive idea of their size) that their
flesh is of no account, save to either the starving, who are
bound by no laws, or the glutton seeking for an article of
food to whet a jaded palate, like the old emperors of
Rome who ate nightingale’s tongues, forsooth! We do
not wish to breed or encourage such barbarians in our
America. At the same time, these birds have great value
in their insect-eating capacity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pop says they always used to shoot Meadowlarks
when he was a boy, and up to not very long ago,” said
Tommy, “and Yellowhammers and Pigeons and Doves
and Robins, too, but now nobody dares, except on the sly.
Anyway, the Wild Pigeons grandfather tells of are all gone,
and I’ve only seen a couple of Doves this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The birds you speak of are now protected by law, here
in Connecticut,” said Gray Lady, “though in some states
they are not, but the game-birds I mean are the little
Killdeer Plover, and the Upland and other small Plovers,
together with the Sandpipers, both of fresh and salt
water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, children, who live with green fields about you, all
know the <a id='mead1'></a>Meadowlark by sight and sound, even if you
never have had the curiosity to learn its name. It is the
bird seen walking in old fields and lowlands. In size
it is a little larger than a Robin, with a rather flat head
and long, stout bill, its back speckled and streaked with
brown and black, and a beautiful yellow throat and
breast crossed by a crescent of black. When the bird is
on the ground, if you came behind it, at a distance, you
might think it a Flicker, but the moment it takes to the
air with a whirring flight, the white feathers at the outside
of the tail show plainly, and name it Meadowlark, just as
the white rump names the Flicker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, you know its voice, that sometimes drops from
a tree, sometimes rises from the grass, that Mr. Burroughs
says calls, ‘Spring o’ the year—Spring o’ the year.’ The
notes are clear as a flute, and, beautiful as our Meadowlark’s
song is, that of his brother, the Prairie Lark, is still
more melodious, and I shall never forget the first spring
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
morning that I heard it from the border of one of those
endless grain-fields that roll on to meet the sky like a
glistening green sea with its waters stirred by the breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Meadowlark is certainly a thing of beauty, but,
at the same time, its greater service to man is its usefulness;
not as a bit of meat, no matter how plump it may grow,
but as the untiring guardian of the fields, where it spends
its life and makes its nest home in a grass tussock. For
this bird, of the eastern United States, is with us here in
Southern New England, and southward, all the year, and
those flocks that migrate do not leave until late fall,
and are back again by the middle of March, while the
Prairie Lark covers the western part of the country, as
permanent warden of the meadow and hayfields. All
the year they keep at work; from March to December insect
food is the chief part of the diet; insects that are the
farmer’s bane,—grasshoppers, cutworms, sow-bugs, ticks,
weevils, plant-lice, and the click-beetle (the grown-up wire
worm) being but a few of them. The remaining months,
December, January, and February, insects failing, waste
grain is eaten, and weed seeds, as pigeon grass, rag and
smart weed, and black mustard.</p>

the New England and Middle States, but, if we have
friends who live in Florida, North Carolina, Georgia,
Alabama, Louisiana and Tennessee, Missouri and Idaho,
where the Larks are only considered as food, let us beg them
to tell every one of this and the Prairie Lark’s merits, so
that they may be placed on the list of the protected. And
when you hear any one say that the Meadowlark is by
rights a game-bird, say as politely as may be, but very
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
firmly, ‘No; it is <span class='it'>not</span>! At least, not in staunch, common-sensed
New England!’</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><a id='dove1'></a><span class='it'>The Mourning Dove</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Soft of plumage, gentle, and almost sad of voice is
the Mourning Dove, the grayish brown bird with metallic
lustres, whose name is taken from its plaintive accents.
Its comings and goings are silent, and, in spite of its size,
for it is as large as the Meadowlark, if it was not for its
cooing, heard early in the morning, we should seldom
know of its presence, for its flight is noiseless, and it chooses
trees in secluded places for the little loose bunch of sticks
that forms its nest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Formerly, this Dove, together with its cousin, the
Passenger Pigeon, were everywhere to be found, while
the Passenger Pigeon, a bird of fine flesh, was so plentiful
as to be almost a staple article of food, and wagons
loaded with birds were peddled through city streets.
With the wastefulness of a people coming to a new and
liberal country, the birds were often shot down in their
roosts, from pure wantonness, and left to decay upon the
ground, so that now the Passenger Pigeon and the wild
buffalo have gone to the happy animal-country, where
there is no hunting, together,—two valuable animals
practically extinct,—and North America is the poorer
for its thoughtlessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With this warning before us, the Kind Hearts’, of which
there are plenty everywhere, whether they are banded
into clubs or not, should strive to have this gentle, harmless
life protected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why?’ says the farmer, in the states that refuse protection.
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
‘Maybe it doesn’t do any harm, but what good
can it do that can make up to me for not eating it?’ To
such a man say this: The Mourning Dove is a consumer
of evil weeds, and its presence in flocks will lessen his
labour and give his hoe arm a rest; that the crop of a dove,
examined by the Department of Agriculture in Washington,
was found to hold 9200 seeds of noxious weeds! <span class='it'>Not
to have these weeds grow</span> would give the farmer, or his boy,
time for a half holiday, wherein to go clamming or berry
picking!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we have some little birds whose names are still
on the list of food- or game-birds, and I should like to see
them wiped from it forever, or, at least, until they are
once more plentiful in their haunts. These are the two
<a id='least'></a><a id='spot1'></a>cousins of the Woodcock,—Sandpipers, the Spotted and
the Least, and two Plovers, also water-loving birds, the
<a id='killd1'></a>Killdeer and the <a id='plovup'></a>Upland Plover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most of you children, at some part of the season, go
down to the shore of the bay yonder, perhaps it may be
when your fathers gather seaweed in the spring and fall,
in late summer for the snapper fishing, or all through the
autumn and early winter for long-necked clams. Some
of you, I know, like Tommy and Dave, have camped out
there for several weeks. Have you not noticed the little
prints of birds’ feet just above the edge of tide-water?
Or have you not seen the little birds themselves, no bigger
than Sparrows, with streaked, brown-gray backs and
soft white feathers underneath, running to and fro,
balancing when they feed, as if making a courtesy, all the
while whispering softly among themselves?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
“Or, again, others slightly larger, with ash and brown
backs, and underparts spotted with round, black marks
like a thrush, white spotted wings, and the outer tail-feathers
white barred, showing in flight?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These two gracious, confiding little birds are the Least
and the Spotted Sandpiper. Their small size should
keep them off the food list, for what are their dead bodies
but a single mouthful? And what are they alive? Things
of joy and mystery combined. For what is a more perfect
picture of grace and happiness than these birds with
a background of sand, seaweed, and shells, and all the
sparkling water before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of a gray day, their pleasant prattle is shut down
by the fog, and sounds strange and mysterious, and when
they spread their pointed wings, and vanish into the mist,
that seems to pick them up as it rolls in, the picture is
complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Least Sandpiper, the smallest of his tribe, is
found in greater numbers on our beach than the Spotted.
He comes to us in the migrations, as he nests only in the
far North. I can remember, when as a girl I was fond
of swiming in the bay until late in autumn, that a flock
of these little birds flew over me so close that I could feel
the beating of their wings. His use is to give interest to the
landscape, and his plea for life his harmless littleness, his
confidence, and his obedience in filling the place in nature
which the great Plan has given him. Perhaps you may
have heard the poem that he inspired in the heart of one
woman, who lived on a sea-girt island, and, oftentimes,
had only the birds for company; even if you have heard
it, the verses are among those of which we never tire.</p>

“The spotted Sandpiper, in my girlhood, was here, with
us, a familiar bird of moist meadows and pond edges, and
every season I used to see them stepping about the stones
in the little brook that flows through the river woods,
across the meadow above the orchard. They frequently
nested there, also, and I have often seen the buff, chocolate,
spotted eggs. I have seen the birds wading in the stream
quite up to their bodies, sometimes dragging their legs
after them as children do in play; they can also swim,
when they wish to cross a stream without taking to wing,
and it is said, when hard pressed or wounded, can dive
deep and swim, or rather, fly under water very swiftly,
for they use the wings as the Loon does. Teeter and
Tip-up are two of its common names, because it seems to be
always balancing in order not to tumble over. If you
startle it, it gives a frightened cry like ‘peet-weet-weet,’
as it rises, but soon drops again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This bird has a list of good deeds as an insect eater
to plead for its removal from the list of game-birds. Birds
consume the most insects in the nesting season when the
quick-growing young require constant feeding, and, as it
breeds all over North America as far as Hudson Bay,
you can see that the Spotted Sandpiper’s field of usefulness
is very wide, and wherever he goes, following the sun as
he does throughout the seasons, his value, aside from his
dainty beauty, does not lie in the morsel of food he would
make for those short sighted enough to shoot him, but in
the insects of all sorts, including grasshoppers and locusts,
he kills in the simple process of getting a living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='killd2'></a>Another bird of the moist meadows of rivers and salt
creeks is the Killdeer or Little Ring-necked Plover. It
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
is about the size of the Spotted Sandpiper, equally beautiful,
and with a certain dignity all its own. We always
used to have them in the river meadows, but, since my
return this year, I have not seen a single one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have found the curious, creamy, pear-shaped eggs,
with brown spots, in a grassy hollow, with no other bed than
the turf itself. Strange eggs they are, seemingly so much
too large for their owners, and an apparently careless
arrangement to leave them with no protecting nest.
But the shape of the egg prevents accident, for, if disturbed,
they simply turn round and round on the pointed
end, but do not roll away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young chicks are the prettiest little creatures;
even when first hatched, they are well covered with down,
and have strong, useful legs, with which they can follow
their parents all day long until their pinions have developed
to let them fly. It is a peculiarity of the game-bird
that, like our domestic poultry, the chick comes from
the egg open-eyed, well covered, and able, in a measure, to
care for itself from the moment that it is hatched. The
song-birds, birds of prey, and others are hatched blind
and naked, and require several weeks’ time before they are
fit for independent life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No prettier scene of young bird-life can be drawn than
that of Mother Killdeer, walking through the dewy meadows,
with stately gait, followed by her four chicks, now
brooding them with a warning cry, if the shadow of a
hawk appears; now turning over leaves and bits of dead
wood in search of their insect food. When danger is
near, the young squat, and the blending of their colours
with those of the ground gives them the benefit of what is
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
known as ‘colour protection,’ a wise plan of Heart of Nature
for the benefit of the weaker species. If threatened
danger does not pass by, then the old birds become
aggressive, and sometimes fly at the intruder, be he
man or animal. The peculiar call of the bird, ‘Killdee-Killde-e-e-Killdeer,’
has given it its name, though it has
several other cries when brooding and protecting its
young.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The desire to protect this charming bird, that the
National Association of the Audubon Societies is endeavouring
to have made a law, state by state, is, after all, nothing
new. Listen to what Audubon himself wrote about the
Killdeer, beginning with the nesting time: ‘At this period
the parents, who sit alternately on the eggs, never leaving
them to the heat of the sun, are extremely clamorous at
the sight of an enemy. The female droops her wings,
emits her plaintive notes, and endeavours, by every means
she can devise, to draw you from her nest or young. The
male dashes over you in the air and vociferates all the
remonstrances of an angry parent whose family is endangered.
If you cannot find pity for the poor birds at such a
time, you may take up their eggs and see their distress,
but if you be at all so tender hearted as I would wish you
to be, it will be quite unnecessary for me to recommend
mercy.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, children of the Kind Hearts’ Club, ask all those you
meet to help put the little Killdeer upon the protected
list; say that it is too small to be counted as food, and,
in addition, whisper to every farmer you meet (and
farmers north, south, east, and west should be interested,
for the bird inhabits the whole of temperate North America),
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
‘The Killdeer is an insect eater, taking grasshoppers,
crickets, beetles, boll weevils, and the dreaded Rocky
Mountain locust.’ If this is not enough, add that the Kind
Hearts wish to protect all these gentle little birds, that are
out of place on the list of food-birds, and we all know that
when a kind heart <span class='it'>wishes</span> to do a thing, it usually finds
the way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody told Dad at the last Farmers’ Institute
that the Reed birds, that the big boys go gunning for down
in the marsh meadows along in August, are changed <a id='bobo4'></a>Bobolinks,”
said Tommy, “and that we mustn’t shoot them any
more, because Bobolinks are singing-birds, and I just
guess they are. My! can’t they sing, and fly right up at
the same time, as if going so fast shook the song out of
them, and they couldn’t help it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady laughed at Tommy’s description, which
was certainly very true, and expressed in vigorous boy
language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Tommy, the black-white-and-buff Bobolink of
May, after the midsummer moult, becomes a dull, brown-striped
bird like his wife, and, shedding his lovely voice
and glowing feathers together, he keeps only a call note.
In this masquerade he leads a double, and somewhat
vagabond, life, travelling by slow degrees toward his winter
home and then back again in the spring, all the while
eating many things which the owners do not wish him to
have, one being rice,—rice in the ear and the sprouting
rice in spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let others do as they must, but we, who have no rice
to be hurt, insist that this bit of ardent, flying melody
shall receive the treatment that his music deserves, and
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
be taken forever off the list of semigame-birds. What if
this singer of the opera does choose to don a sober travelling
cloak and journey silently? The musician is only
waiting for the pink blossoms to come on the apple trees,
and the grass to grow long enough to sway to the wind,
to again let his music float from the one and give his nest
to the care of the other, where no human eye, at least,
may spy it. If we destroy Robert of Lincoln, called
Bobolink for short, we kill not one but many qualities
and songs. Did you never hear the rhyme of his merry

<div><span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span><h1>XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>TREASURE-TROVE AT THE SHORE</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><a id='gull1'></a><span class='it'>The Herring or Harbour Gull</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>The autumn had been clear and fine, and the hillside
farmers of Fair Meadows township had their out-of-door
work well in hand by Thanksgiving. The fall-sown rye
was well up, and the fields that were to lie fallow and be
sweetened by the frost were ploughed and in good shape.
Ice-cutting, on the chain of large ponds that lay in the
valley between the hills north of the river woods, was an
important industry of the region, so that every one was
anxious to have the ice form clear and firm before snowfall.
As yet, however, there had been no signs of either, except
the thin ice with which Black Frost always covers the roof,
gutters, water-pails, and shallow pools when he prowls
round in the early morning, as if merely to let the good
folks know of his presence, and to prepare them for his
gentler mediating brother, Snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day after Thanksgiving the wind began to blow,
not in mere passing gusts, but steadily and systematically.
Then, too, it came from a strange quarter for that season—the
extreme southeast. This was the wind to drive
the sea into the bay and force the water high on
shore. Such winds, at this season, piled the elastic brown
seaweed in long lines high above tide-water, and many a
farmer, and market-gardener, as he ate his supper, laid
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
plans to drive down to the beach next morning, with a
double team, and secure a full load of the weed for covering
his strawberry or asparagus beds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before morning, however, a driving rain set in that
lasted for two days and kept everybody house-bound.
The roadways ran water like rivers, and, by the time the
storm lessened at sunset Sunday evening, there was barely
a leaf left on the apple trees of the Birdland orchard, and
Goldilocks was well-nigh heartbroken over the state of
the lunch-counter, for, in spite of the protecting roof, the
broken biscuits turned to paste, the suet hung in rags,
and as for the kernels of cracked corn and the buckwheat,
they had swelled as if they thought it was a spring
rain and it was their duty to grow. So that Goldilocks
was worried lest some Juncos and Goldfinches that made
a hearty meal upon the grains, in spite of the rain, should
suffer from a fit of indigestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early Monday morning, when he returned to milk, the
hired man at Tommy Todd’s, who had been spending the
night with his brother at one of the little huts four miles
below on the shore road, brought word that the great
storm had, as he expressed it, “heaved” the deep-water
oyster-beds that extended out through the bay and that
in addition to the seaweed, the beach was completely
covered with fine large oysters, bushels and bushels of
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How the news spread, nobody knew, but by half-past
eight every available team within a mile of Foxes Corners
school was “hooked up” and entire families were hurrying
toward the beach in every sort of vehicle, to gather up
this unexpected treasure-trove of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
The parents seemed to have entirely forgotten that
school began at nine, and it was not to be expected that the
children should remind them. And, truth be told, when
Jared Barnes gathered his flock, grandma included, into
the hay wagon, Sarah and Ruth, conscientious as they
usually were about their lessons, entirely forgot the day of
the week, so eager were they for the fray; for the prospect,
not only of oysters to roast and stew, but of oysters to pickle
and keep, was too great a temptation to resist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Wilde, who arrived at the schoolhouse rather
earlier than usual, found the door locked, and no fire in
the stove. It was Dave’s week to tend the fire, and, as
Miss Wilde stood in the open doorway pondering on the
matter, one of the most exacting of the school committee
men came bumping along in a lumber cart. Pulling up his
horses so suddenly that a neighbour who was with him
tipped backward off the seat, he called to the astonished
teacher: “You had best close up and go home; you won’t
have any pupils to-day. Or else come down, and hold
school on the shore! The rest of the committee will
probably meet together in a few minutes, and we’ll vote
to extend Thanksgiving holidays over to-day.” So
saying, he cracked his whip and rattled downhill, leaving
Miss Wilde to wonder if he was losing his mind, or the
world was turning topsyturvy, or if she was still asleep,
for it was beginning to be hard to wake up as the mornings
shortened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Wilde locked the door and started to walk toward
Eliza Clausen’s house, that being the nearest place where
she could possibly find out what was happening. As she
reached the cross-road that met the turnpike a little above
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>
the school, she heard the sharp trot of hoofs, and, turning
in that direction, saw Jacob Hughes driving the depot
rockaway, Goldilocks being beside him and Gray Lady
seated behind. Goldilocks waved her hand on seeing Miss
Wilde, and in another minute “teacher” was seated beside
Gray Lady, and not only knew of the avalanche of oysters,
but was herself on the way to the shore with her friends,
who were going, not for the sake of the oysters, but to
enjoy what was sure to be a picturesque scene, with the
shell-strewn beach, the sharp bluff on the left, and the
long sand-bar, with its lighthouse on the right, for a setting.
Nor were they disappointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For once tell-tale news did not exaggerate, and, though
there were many cut and scratched fingers from the sharp
shells, before noon there was no one who had not gathered
all the oysters he could carry. The more thrifty among
the men also began to gather the seaweed into heaps safe
from the incoming tide, so that they might be sure of finding
it the next day, while the women and children gathered
driftwood and, making fireplaces of a few stones, heated
the coffee they had brought. For, though the sun was
now shining clear, and the wind had dropped to a little
breeze that scarcely moved the surface of the tide pools,
there was a growing keenness in the air that named the
month “December,” and promised the wind would be in
the northwest by night.</p>

<img src='images/i289.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0034' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>HERRING GULLS</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><a id='gull2'></a>In spite of the unusual human picture before them,
that which interested Gray Lady, Miss Wilde, and Goldilocks
the most were the Gulls that covered the bare sand-bar,
waded in the shallow pools, and clambered among the
stones in search of food, which they picked out with their
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
stout, hooked bills, then flew swiftly overhead toward the
creek, across the salt meadows, with a shrill cry, such as
the creaking windlass of a well gives when the rope plays
out quickly and the bucket drops—“quake-wake-wake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further out, in the arm of the bar, where there was no
current, and the water was deep and smooth, many Gulls
were resting motionless as white skiffs at anchor, or
flying and diving for food in the wake of some boats that
were evidently grappling to discover the extent of the
damage to the oyster-beds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many kinds of Gulls are there?” asked Goldilocks.
“Three, I should think, unless the males and the females
were different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Gulls here are all Herring, or, as the Wise Men
now wish them called, ‘Harbour Gulls.’ The old birds have
the pure white breasts and pearly gray, or what is sometimes
called ‘Gull-blue,’ upper parts and the black-and-white
wing-markings. The mixed and streaked ash,
buff, and brown birds are the young of the year, while the
black-and-white patched birds are not Gulls, but Old
Squaw Ducks. These have spent the winter about the bay
and bar ever since I can remember, and, strangely enough,
both Gulls and Ducks seem to be no less in number than
they were twenty years ago. That is probably because
the Gulls are protected, and the Ducks’ flesh is so tough
that even a hungry dog could hardly tear it apart. I hope
your children are noticing these birds while they are
gathering driftwood for the fires,” Gray Lady said to Miss
Wilde. “It is very seldom that they come to the shore as
late as this, or see the Gulls in such numbers. It seems
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
to-day as though the storm must have driven all that
belong to many miles of coast to take shelter in this bay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they are looking,” said Goldilocks, “for Sarah
and Tommy and Dave and Clary, who are all together
by the nearest fire, are watching and pointing to the Gulls
that are over by the boats, and I think that Bobby has
found a dead Gull tangled in seaweed and he is showing
it to the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I foresee that the Harbour Gull will be the bird
of next Friday afternoon,” said Gray Lady, as they turned
homeward, taking Miss Wilde with them for lunch, so
that Gray Lady might talk over a new plan concerning
the old farm-house in the corner of the orchard, with its
great stone chimney where the Swifts loved to build.</p>

<hr class='tbk110'/>

<p class='pindent'>As Gray Lady had expected, the next Friday afternoon,
when she went to Foxes Corners schoolhouse, she was
greeted by many enthusiastic accounts of the stolen holiday
at the shore, but a perfect chorus of questions arose
about the “big birds that fly and swim and yet aren’t
quite like Ducks”; while Bobby proudly produced his
treasured Gull, wrapped in a newspaper, at the same time
assuring Gray Lady, as became a member of the Kind
Hearts’ Club, that he hadn’t thrown a stone at it, or anything,
and that it was “drowned dead in the seaweed.”
All of which she already knew to be true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why aren’t the Gulls there in the summer when we go
down camping and clamming?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” said Gray Lady, “they do not like very
warm weather, and nowadays at least, though they live
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
all through North America, they do not nest on the Atlantic
coast south of Maine. For this reason, we seldom see
them between May and October, and that is the very time
that you children and people in general visit the shore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must take a pretty big tree to hold a Gull’s nest,”
said Dave, picking up the bird and weighing it in his hand;
“it’s lots bigger than a Crow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; a Gull measures two feet in length (that is, from
the tip of its beak over its back to the tail, which is the
way the length of a bird is reckoned), and is quite three
feet across the spread of its open wings, while the body
of the Crow is five inches shorter and the wings only
spread a little over two feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You probably noticed, the other day, what very long,
pointed wings the Gulls have. But though these Gulls
do sometimes nest in fairly high trees and in bushes, it is
not common, and their favourite place is on the gray
shingle, and among the stones of rocky beaches well above
tide-water, or else between tussocks of beach grass or
sheltering pieces of driftwood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a Gull’s chief food is gleaned from the sea, it must
nest as close as possible to its source of supply. You
can easily see that so large a bird could never be free from
annoyance on our bathing beaches or offshore islands that
are used as summer resorts; so, as people flocked to the
shore, more and more, the places where Gulls might nest
in comfort grew fewer and fewer, and they were driven to
the remote islands like those off the Maine coast, Great
Duck Island, No Man’s Land, and others, and it is at
Great Duck Island that is to be found the largest colony
of Gulls within the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>
“But even here and on many lesser islands, with only
lighthouses and their keepers for company, where there
were no summer cottages or pleasure-seekers, until a few
years ago, the Gulls were not safe, for they, like the White
Herons of the South, were bonnet martyrs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bonnet martyrs!” exclaimed Eliza Clausen, jumping
as if some one had stuck a pin in her. “I don’t think they
would look one bit nice on hats; why, they are so big that
there wouldn’t be any hat, but all bird.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are quite right,” said Gray Lady, “but the whole
Gull was not used. These beautiful white breast-feathers
were made into turbans. Perhaps, on one side of
these, a smaller cousin of the Gull, the Tern, or Sea
Swallow, with its coral-red beak, would be perched by
way of finish. Or else, soft bands made of the breast,
and some of the handsomest wing quills were used for
trimming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not only were these feathers sold wholesale to the
plume merchants and milliners, but people who went to
the coast resorts would buy them of the sailors simply
because they were pretty, without giving a thought to
the lives they cost, or of how desolate and lonely the
shores would be when there were no more Gulls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are comparatively few people, I earnestly believe,
who would wear feathers for ornament if they realized
the waste of life that the habit causes. It is largely
because people do not stop to think, and they do not
associate the happy living bird with the lifeless feathers
in the milliner’s window. But now that the Wise Men—yes,
and wise women, too—have explained the matter, the
protection of these beautiful sea-birds is an established fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>
“This bird was called ‘Herring Gull,’ because by hovering
over the schools of Herring where they swam, and
diving to get them for food, they told the fishermen, who
spend their lives upon the ocean on the lookout, where
the fish were to be found. Now, though the Gulls still do
this, they do better work, also, for they spend the time
that they are away from their nesting-homes about the
harbours of the large cities, making daily trips up the
rivers and cleansing the water of refuse, upon which they
feed. For this reason, ‘Harbour Gull’ seems to be a
better name for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are very sociable birds at all times of the year,
keeping in colonies even in the breeding season, a time
when song- and other land-birds pair, and prefer to be alone.
The nests, when on the ground or upon flat rocks, are built
of grass, mosses, seaweed, and bits of soft driftwood
formed into a shallow bowl. If the edges of this crumble
or flatten while the birds are sitting, they use bunches of
fresh grass or seaweed to keep it in repair, with the result
that the nest is not only a very tasteful object, but it
blends perfectly with its surroundings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The eggs are very interesting because no two seem to
be of the same colour, being of every shade of blue and
gray, from the colour of summer sky and sand to the tint
of the many-coloured, water-soaked rocks themselves.
The markings vary also in shape and size, and are in
every shade of brown, through lilac and purple, to black.
The parents are very devoted to their nests, and take
turns in sitting, though the eggs are often left to the care
of the sun on days when it is sufficiently warm. When
the young are first hatched, though covered with down,
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
they are very weak in the neck and helpless; but in the
course of a few hours the little Gulls are strong enough to
walk, and the instinct to hide at the approach of anything
strange comes to them very suddenly, so that a Gull
only three or four hours old will slip out of the nest and
either hide beneath a few grass blades or flatten itself in
the sand, where, owing to its spotted, colour-protective
down, it is almost invisible, so well does Nature care for
her children—provided that man does not interfere.
When a Gull nests in a tree, however, the little birds, not
feeling the same necessity for hiding, do not try to leave
the nest until the growth of their wings will let them fly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the sea beaches squids and marine refuse are fed
to the young Gulls, but where they have nested near fresh,
instead of salt, water many insects gleaned from the fields
are eaten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was in the Gulls’ nesting season that the plunderers
chose to go to their island haunts, steal the eggs, and kill
the parent birds, whose devotion, like that of the White
Heron, left the birds at the mercy of the plume hunters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the end of summer the young, wearing their
speckled suits, are able to join the old in flocks, and it is
then that they scatter along the coast, some going from
the northern borders down to the Great Lakes. In and
about New York City they are one of the features of the
winter scenery; they fly to and fro under the arches of the
great bridge, and follow the ships the entire length of the
harbour and out to sea. At night they bed down so close
together that in places they make a continuous coverlid of
feathers on the waters of the reservoirs and in the sheltered
coves of the Hudson. From the banks of Riverside Park,
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
any autumn or winter afternoon, so long as the channel is
free from ice, they may be seen flying about as fearless
as a flock of domestic Pigeons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here on our beach they are scary enough,” said
Tommy. “Why, the other day I tried every way to creep
up close to some of them, but I never could; they were
always up and off, sometimes without saying a word, and
sometimes screeching, ‘Yuka-yuka-yuka,’ enough to
frighten any one. Pop says that, way back when he was
a boy, and there weren’t any laws to prevent shooting
anything except the game-birds out of season, that these
birds were just as scary, so that the best shots used to
go down on the bar and try to hit a Gull, not to eat, but
for the sake of being called a good shot, because Gulls
were harder to get than old leader Crows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the very reason why Gulls alongshore are
afraid now. For so many years they have served as
targets for Duck hunters, and people who did not realize
what they were destroying, that fear has become an instinct.
Now in the nesting-haunts, where they are protected,
they are gradually becoming more and more
tame. About the harbours of cities and parks, where
shooting has never been allowed for other reasons than
bird protection, they fly about unconcernedly and exhibit
little alarm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are Gulls any real use, except that they are nice to
look at and watch fly?” asked Dave, presently, as Bobbie’s
bird was being passed from desk to desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the Harbour Gulls are useful in many ways, and
would be more so if man would protect them fully everywhere,
as they do in some countries and in some of the
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
western parts of our own country; but, in general, they have
been so persistently hunted that they shun the land-bound
fresh water, where they would help the farmers by feeding
on large insects, and prefer the freedom of the open water.”</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“The true Gull of the sea, the spirit of the salt, is a sort
of feathered bell-buoy, and thus is of use to the sailors,
as there is ample testimony to prove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In summer, in thick weather, the appearance of Gulls
and Terns in numbers, or the sound of their clamorous
voices, gives warning to the mariner that he is near the
rocks on which they breed. Shore fishermen, enshrouded
in fog, can tell the direction of the islands on which the
birds live by watching their undeviating flight homeward
with food for their young. The keen senses of sea-birds
enable them to head direct for their nests, even in dense
mist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Navigators approaching their home ports during the
seasons of bird migration welcome the appearance of
familiar birds from the land.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sea-birds must be reckoned among the chief agencies
which have made many rocky or sandy islands fit for human
habitation. The service performed by birds in fertilizing,
soil-building, and seed-sowing on many barren
islands entitles our feathered friends to the gratitude of
many a shipwrecked sailor, who must else have lost his
life on barren, storm-beaten shores.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Is mine a good grown-up Gull?” asked Bobbie, who
had been waiting anxiously for its safe return to his
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
hands, “because grandpa says if it is, he’ll take it over
to town, and get it stuffed, and fixed up on a perch, to
remember Oyster Day by; but I’ll bury it if you’d rather
I would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a fully grown bird, Bobbie,” said Gray Lady,
“and it is wearing its winter dress. In summer the head
and neck that are now streaked with gray would be a
dazzling white, and as accident killed it, and wind and
tide gave it to you, there is no reason why you may not
keep it with a clear conscience.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span><h1>XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE BIRDS’ CHRISTMAS TREE</span></h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1.2em;'><span class='it'>Preparation</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Christmas sale was over. It had been held in the
play and work rooms the Saturday before Christmas, and
was a great success. The dressed dolls, iron-holders,
aprons, bird-houses, wooden spoons, racks for clothes,
and little knickknacks had been ranged on the work-table
and carpenter’s bench, and all the people of the
neighbouring towns, as well as from Fair Meadows village
itself, had been asked to come and see. When they came
and saw, they stayed to buy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bird-houses proved the greatest novelty, and
Tommy Todd and Dave, their cheeks red with excitement,
were kept busy taking orders for more, to be finished
by May or June, one customer said. She, however,
was very much amused when Tommy told her that if she
expected to have birds in the house (it was a box for Tree Swallows)
the first season, she must have the house in
place before April, so that it might “be weathered a little,
and the birds find it when they first came, and not think
it was a trap put up to catch them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady donated some delicious cake of Ann’s
make, and hot chocolate, and while the visitors enjoyed it,
they asked many questions about the bird class, the school
at Foxes Corners, and the motives of the Kind Hearts’
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
Club itself; for this name had been printed on the posters
advertising the sale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result that concerned the public good was that other
men and women resolved, even if they could not do it as
thoroughly as Gray Lady, to supply the teachers in their
various districts with charts and books, and before night
settled down, Sarah Barnes, the treasurer of the Club, was
hugging tight in her arms a small iron box, with a lock
and key, wherein were fifty precious dollars, while
orders that meant an equal sum before the close of the
school year were being copied from a rather mussy paper
into a blank-book, by Tommy Todd, the secretary, whose
usually clear upright letters were made crooked by his
excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next question was, How should the money be spent?
Each child was asked to write his or her idea on a slip of
paper and bring it to the birds’ Christmas festival that
was to be held, as seemed fitting, in Birdland, the afternoon
before Christmas, from two o’clock until four.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supposin’ it’s cold and snowy?—that’s a long time to
be outdoors,” said Eliza Clausen, as she walked home
between Sarah and Ruth Barnes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may not be out-of-doors,” said Sarah, looking very
wise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it can’t be in Birdland, as Gray Lady said,”
persisted Eliza, who, though she was less critical since
she had come under the older woman’s influence, could
not resist once in a while, “hoping for the worst,” as Gray
Lady called borrowing trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; the party can be indoors, and yet in Birdland,”
answered Sarah.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
“Oh, you’re trying to catch me with a riddle or something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I am, I’ll tell you the answer at the birds’ Christmas
tree next Tuesday,” called Sarah, as she turned in at her
own gate.</p>

<hr class='tbk111'/>

<p class='pindent'>A two-inch fall of soft, clinging snow fell during the
night before Christmas eve, so that the next morning
“everything looked as pretty as the pictures on a calendar,”
as Sarah Barnes said, when she arrived at Gray
Lady’s door, bright and early, to help decorate the birds’
tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sarah did not enter the door, however, for she was
joined on the porch by Goldilocks and Ann, and together
they walked through the garden to Birdland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jacob Hughes had swept paths from the house in and
out among the trees through the garden. In Birdland
he had used the single-horse snow-plough to scrape a
track running from the bird lunch-counter, about the
edge of the orchard, and then through the centre down to
the old farm-house of the Swallow Chimney, that stood in
the lower corner facing on what had been a cross-road, but
was now a pretty grass-grown lane, with the snow wreathing
the bushes of black alder, with its red, glistening
berries, giving out a real Christmas feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had happened to the old house of the Swallow
Chimney, where the General’s father had lived, but which
had now remained closed for so many years, merely a
storage-place for old furniture?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smoke was coming from the great stone chimney, new
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>
shingles stained to look old replaced the broken ones,
new paint glistened on the window-sashes, and the quaint
old panes of glass, bearing the rainbow tints of years,
shone like mirrors. The front door was painted dark
green, and the spread-eagle knocker of brass was as bright
as polishing could make it; while around the deep front
porch was a little fence of cedar bushes in boxes, all garlanded
with vines of coral, bittersweet berries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goldilocks and Sarah went to the front door of the old
house, while Ann disappeared in the woodshed that
joined the side porch and well-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls had not touched the knocker when the door
flew open, and who should stand there but Miss Rose Wilde,
while beyond her, sitting by the blazing log-fire in the
long, low living-room, that had once been the kitchen, was
her mother, looking better and younger than she had for
at least ten years!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the secret. Gray Lady had repaired the old
house and established the faithful little teacher and her
mother in it, so that instead of mother and daughter only
meeting once a week, or less often in winter, and each
having a good bit of heartache between, they had a real
home once more. What was also a bit of good luck, Mrs.
Wilde’s furniture, that had been stored away, was of the
kind that seemed as if it had been made for the old homestead
and had never been anywhere else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once inside, Rose Wilde led them into the kitchen, where
everything was as neat as wax, and there, spread upon
tables and half-covering the floor, were the decorations for
the birds’ Christmas tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where was the tree itself? Where trees are the best
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>
and healthiest, out-of-doors back of the house, a stout,
young spruce, some twenty odd feet high, growing in the
orchard corner where no one had planted it, the child of
one of the spruces near the great house,—a half-wild tree,
sprung from the seed of a cone dropped by a Crossbill,
perhaps, or left by a squirrel who was making a winter
store-house in the attic of the farm-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dainties for the tree were selected to suit all the
various needs and appetites of the winter birds likely to
come to the orchard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady, Goldilocks, Rose Wilde, and Ann had
strung quantities of popcorn upon the chance of the Jays
and Crows liking it. They had used strong thread, but
had only strung the corn by the very edge, so that it would
detach easily. There were lumps of suet, and marrow-bones,
securely bound with wire, ears of red and yellow
corn, bunches of unthreshed rye, wheat, and oats, little
open boxes filled with beechnuts, and various wild berries.
Last of all, something that Goldilocks had suggested, the
heads of a couple of dozen sunflowers, filled with the ripe,
nutritious seeds, for she had noticed that all the autumn
the Goldfinches and various Sparrows had stayed about
the beds where the composite flowers like asters, marigolds,
cornflowers, zinnias, and sunflowers grew, and that
also the wild sunflowers and black-eyed Susans of waste
fields were always surrounded by birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jacob Hughes had his ladders all ready, but it was no
small task to keep him supplied with material, and there
were many mishaps before all the articles were in place,
but to Goldilocks’ great joy, before Jacob had fairly finished
and taken the ladder away, <a id='cdee3'></a>a Chickadee and a
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
Goldfinch were both clinging to the same sunflower head,
and a little Downy Woodpecker had discovered one of
the bones fastened to a branch and was revelling, “up to
his neck,” as Sarah expressed it, in the marrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Underneath the tree a place had been cleared for the
gifts Gray Lady had in store for what she called “the
featherless two-legged birds of the Kind Hearts’ Club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After they had rested a few minutes, and were thoroughly
warmed, Gray Lady, Rose Wilde, Goldilocks, and Sarah
Barnes set out for a stroll through the orchard, and the
lane that ran back of it, up to the farm-barns, to see what
feathered guests were in the neighbourhood, the walk
taking them past a great pile of unhewn wood and a tent-shaped
brush-heap at the end of the lane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady used her opera-glasses, but the others trusted
to their eyes alone. These are the birds they saw and named
easily: <a id='gold1'></a>A flock of Goldfinches in their dull winter coats
feeding on weed seeds in the lane; their old friends the
Chickadees, three Blue Jays, two Flickers, and several
Downy Woodpeckers; Gray Lady thought possibly from
their markings, a whole Downy family,—Mr., Mrs., and four
children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they neared the woodpile Goldilocks stopped, her
hand on Gray Lady’s sleeve and a finger raised in caution.
“I do believe there is a Jenny Wren that has not gone
away or is lost, it is such a little bit of a thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they stood looking, <a id='wwren'></a>the little, neat, brown bird, about
four inches long, ran up and down among the logs like a
mouse, then flew with a little short flapping of the wings
to the bush, where it clung to a spray, bobbing to and fro,
its comical bit of a tail pointing as close to its head as
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>
possible. Then it appeared to pick something very
deliberately from the twigs and flew back again to the
woodpile with a sharp, warning note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not a belated House Wren,” said Gray Lady,
“but the <a id='wrenwin'></a>Winter Wren, his cousin, who nests from the
northern boundaries of the states northward, but comes
down in winter to visit us in southern New England and
travels as far south as Florida. A brave little fellow he
is to weather storms and cold here, and one of our three
smallest birds, the Golden-crowned Kinglet and the
Humming-bird being the other two. In his nesting-haunts
he has a beautiful song; I have never heard it, but one of
his admirers who has says that it is ‘full of trills, runs,
and grace notes, a tinkling, rippling roundelay.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later it was Sarah’s turn to exclaim, as
she pointed to a small, sparrow-like bird, perched on a
giant stalk of seeded ragweed at the side of the lane.
“It’s a Chippy or else a Song Sparrow,” she said, hesitatingly.
“It’s bigger than a Chippy, and it’s got a spot on
its breast like the Song Sparrow, only it isn’t as big. O
dear me! I don’t think that I shall ever be sure of telling
Sparrows apart,” she sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure a bird <span class='it'>is</span> a Sparrow is a step in the right
direction,” said Gray Lady. “I have known some one
older than you call me to see a big Sparrow which turned
out to be a Wood Thrush. If you will remember one thing,
it will help you in placing the smaller birds. Look at a
bird’s beak; if it is thick, short, and cone-shaped, the
bird is most likely to be a Sparrow, for this family are all
seed-eaters except in the nesting season, while insect-eating
birds, of all families, have longer and more slender bills.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>TREE-SPARROW</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
“<a id='tree'></a>As for this little fellow, it is another of our winter
visitors, the <a id='chippy'></a><span class='it'>Tree-sparrow</span> or <span class='it'>Winter Chippy</span>, and there is
probably quite a flock of his kin at this moment distributed
over the wild fields below, doing the work of seed-destroying
that the farmers have neglected; for, aside from
the cheerful companionship of all these winter birds, the
Sparrow tribe is working for us all winter as Weed Warriors,<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a>
just as the tree-trunk birds are Tree Trappers, the
birds who take insects while on the wing, Sky Sweepers,
and the silent birds of prey, who sit in wait for the field-mice
and other vermin, Wise Watchers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, it is my turn now to make discoveries,” said
Gray Lady, as they turned into the orchard at the end
opposite the lunch-counter tree. “Keep very quiet, and
look at the mossy branch of that half-dead tree to which
some frozen apples still hang; what do you see, Goldilocks?
Take my glasses and look carefully before you
answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?” said Goldilocks; “yes; I see. One is a little,
fluffy, greenish gray bird with a dirty white breast. Oh!
he has a red stripe edged with yellow on top of his head!
He moves so quickly that I can’t seem to see the whole
of him with one look, though he is small. The other bird
is a little bigger, and not so fat; he has a yellow spot on
his head, and a brighter one over the tail, and a yellow
spot on each side; he is striped gray and black all over,
except some white on his wings and underneath. How
he flits about, just like that bird that looked like a red-and-black
butterfly that we saw last summer that you
said was a <a id='reds1'></a>Redstart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>
“You have very sharp eyes,” said her mother, “for you
saw at once the identifying marks of two birds that were
new to you. <a id='gking'></a>The merry fellow of the flaming crown is
the <a id='king1'></a>Golden-crowned Kinglet, another sturdy winter visitor,
who breeds in the North, and finds our climate quite
warm enough for him if the food holds out; for he is a tree
trapper, giving his attention, like the Chickadee, to the
smaller branches and twigs too slender to bear the weight
of the heavier tree-trunk birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His companion is the <a id='warbmyr1'></a><a id='myrtle'></a>Myrtle or Yellow-rumped
Warbler, a hardy cousin of the Redstart and Summer
Yellowbird that Sarah, perhaps, does not yet know by
name, though she has doubtless seen them. When you
have once seen the male bird, you will never forget him,
because of the four yellow spots. These warblers are great
insect eaters, but lacking these, they will eat berries, the
bayberries being their favourite, and I believe that we
have to thank the bayberry bushes, in the rocky hill
pastures hereabouts, for the numbers of the Myrtle
Warblers that stay all winter, myrtle being a common
title for the bay, giving them their name.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At the garden end of Birdland, just inside the rustic
gate, a flock of <a id='juncobird'></a><a id='junc1'></a>Juncoes or Gray Snowbirds were feeding,
plump, cheerful, and contented, and giving vent to their
satisfaction in their pleasant “tchip, tchip, tchip” call.
Those who only know one winter bird know the Junco,
for he belongs to city parks, village yards, and remote
farms alike, anywhere that a frugal meal of grain or weed
seeds may be found, with a piazza vine or brush-heap or
haystack to creep into for shelter. His flesh-pink bill,
slate-coloured coat, and neat white vest, together with the
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
<span class='it'>two conspicuous white tail-feathers</span>, tell his name to any one
who wishes to know it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Junco is an autumn and winter visitor only, being
away from May until late September, as he nests northward
from New York and Connecticut. When the flocks
first return, you will be puzzled by many birds of the shape
and build of Juncoes, but who are wearing more or less
striped clothes; these are the young of the year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five new birds in one morning! I wish Tommy had
been here,” said Sarah; “but perhaps he knows them
already; Tommy knows a lot you can’t see because it’s
down so deep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must find us a new bird, too, before we go in to
lunch, Miss Wilde,” said Goldilocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been looking at, not one, but a dozen, while you
have been watching the <a id='king2'></a>Kinglet and <a id='warbmyr2'></a>Myrtle Warbler.
Look over the gate-arch across toward the house. Do
you see something moving among the bunches of ripe
spruce cones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see birds moving, but I want to go nearer.” So the
party managed, by walking quietly, to reach the trees where
the birds were feeding without disturbing them in the
least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are two kinds of birds up there,” said Sarah,
presently, for it was her turn to use the opera-glasses.
“They are both rather red. One is darker than the other
and has no white on him. The other is lighter red and
has some white on the wings and tail. Why, Gray Lady!
their beaks are out of joint at the end and don’t shut tight.
I wonder what can have happened to the poor things.
I thought at first they might be wild parrots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
Gray Lady and Miss Wilde both laughed, Sarah’s concern
for the birds was so real.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right about the bills not closing at the tip,
but it is not owing to an accident. Nature developed this
bill so that the bird, who is a lover of evergreen forests,
might be able to wrench open the cones, the only winter
food that is oftentimes to be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bird belongs to the Finch and Sparrow family,
though you would never guess it, and is called the ‘Crossbill.’
<a id='cross1'></a>The <a id='redcross'></a>plain red one is the Red-winged Crossbill, and
the lighter-coloured one, with white markings, the <a id='cross2'></a>White-winged
Crossbill. Both birds nest north of New England,
but travel about the country in little flocks, sometimes
going as far south as Virginia and the Gulf States.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, I think I can hear the crackling as they tear
the scales from the cones,” said Goldilocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and you can see those that they have dropped
lying on the fresh snow under the trees,” added Sarah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment an old-fashioned dinner-bell sounded
from the direction of the farm-house in the orchard. It
was Mrs. Wilde letting them know that luncheon was
ready, for Gray Lady, Goldilocks, and Sarah were to
lunch at “Swallow Chimney,” as Goldilocks had christened
the restored home, by way of a house-warming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they left, the Crossbills, who had been climbing up
and down, with all the adroitness of the Chickadees or the
Upside-down birds themselves, suddenly took to wing,
giving short, metallic-sounding cries, flew rapidly over the
orchard, to alight—where do you suppose? On the birds’
Christmas tree. Here, after some inspection, they began
to tear at the popcorn, their twisted beaks doing the work
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
so well that they seemed fashioned for that purpose
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Goldilocks, her hands clasped in amazement,
as they reached the farm-house, and saw what had
happened, “I never knew anything <span class='it'>quite so quick</span> to
happen outside of a story-book!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At two o’clock a procession of the pupils of Foxes
Corners school filed through the hall at “the General’s,”
wondering what new surprise was in store. The big boys,
who would not begin school until the mid-winter term, had
come under the strong persuasion of Tommy and Dave.
They looked rather uneasy, however, as if they were not
quite sure whether the performances that the younger
boys considered “bully” might not be undignified for men
of their age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the children went through the garden, Jim Crow
lurched out of a bush and walked along after them with
an air of great importance, as if he were the master of
ceremonies. Larry, the Starling, was not particularly
fond of cold weather, and kept inside the shelter of the
south porch, making little excursions here and there,
prompted by curiosity, and the desire to use his wings,
which were now quite strong, as food was to be had from
the dish that he and Jim shared, merely for the eating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lunch-counter was well patronized that afternoon,
for, in addition to the birds that had been in the vicinity
during the morning, several Bluebirds came, together
with three Robins, who simply gorged themselves upon
some dried currants that Goldilocks had put out as an
extra dainty. Gray Lady was trying experiments with
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
all sorts of odds and ends at the lunch-counter, that she
might see exactly what sort of food was the most acceptable,
and she was very much surprised to find that though
wild birds, like human beings, can adapt themselves to
circumstances, a great number have such a craving for
animal food that it explained why Crows, Jays, and some
others become nest-robbers in the midst of summer plenty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After they had called upon Miss Wilde at Swallow
Chimney, where Eliza Clausen discovered the meaning of
Sarah Barnes’ mysterious remarks about the party being
held in the orchard, and yet being indoors, they went to
see the birds’ Christmas tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since morning many things had been added to it that
were not intended for birds. Bundles, strange of shape,
wrapped in green tissue-paper tied up with red ribbon
and little sprigs of southern holly, hung to the lower
branches, while Jacob, dressed as Father Christmas, stood
by armed with a hooked stick, with which he loosened the
bundles and dropped them into the waiting hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it was impossible to tell from the shape of the
parcels what they contained, there was a good deal of
pinching and squeezing done, but beyond the feeling of
sharp corners that might belong to either books or boxes,
nothing could be discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is too cold for you to stand out here to open your
parcels,” said Gray Lady. “Suppose you take them in
the living-room at the cottage, and while the girls open
theirs you boys come for a little walk with me, for I have
some work planned particularly for the boys of the Kind
Hearts’ Club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do not look worried, I shall not keep you more
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
than half an hour,” she said, as she saw the boys were
quite as curious about untying their parcels as the girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, following her lead, they trudged off up the lane, past
the barn and woodpile, to where the brush on either side
narrowed it to a mere path. Then, where another lane
crossed it, the way grew broader again, and while one
side was screened by woods, from the other you could
look out upon a stretch of waste meadows and fallow
fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was only enough snow to crunch underfoot, and
as Gray Lady walked ahead, a sprig of holly fastened at
the neck of her gray chinchilla collar, and another in the
close fitting hat of the same fur, her arms buried to the
elbows in a great muff, her eyes sparkling with pleasure,
and a rosy spot on each cheek made by the keen air, the
boys cast many glances of genuine admiration at her.
The big boys, especially, felt that she understood the situation
exactly, by taking them to walk without the girls,
giving them her confidence, and planning something for
them to do that would be different from girls’ work, or,
at least, apart from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps some of the others have told you,” Gray Lady
said to the big boys as they walked, “that I am very
anxious not only to feed the small tree birds, that they
may stay with us in winter, but to try and help the Grouse
and Quail, so that, instead of those that have escaped the
dangers of the hunting season being driven out by hunger
and cold, they shall live on and increase, and become
again the friends to the farmers that they were in the old
days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You big boys all know how much complaint there is of
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
all kinds of new bugs and worms and blights that discourage
the farmers and leave but little profit in their
crops? As you learn to watch wild birds and their habits,
and realize the way in which they work for their living the
year round, you will see that it is largely the lack of these
old residents, these birds who were here before man came,
that allows all the new-fangled bugs to gain such headway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, while it is quite easy for all of us to have some
sort of a lunch-counter, either on a window-ledge, tree-trunk,
or shed roof,—anywhere, in short, where cats will
not venture,—feeding the larger game-birds is not such
a simple matter, for until they thoroughly understand our
motives, they will not come to us; we must take food to
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Birds that are hunted everywhere, for at least two
months in a year, cannot be expected the day after the
season closes to come boldly to our houses for food, as if
they could consult a calendar, and say to one another,
‘To-day is December first, we may go and take a walk in
the open road in safety.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither would they be safe, for there are always,
I am sorry to say, cowards in every township who will
set snares, and get by stealth what they dare not take
openly. And, of the two, I think the snare a greater
danger to the poor birds than the gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trouble with feeding game-birds away from
houses would be that, even if you knew their runs, and
I think I know some pretty well, the feed would most
likely blow away or be snowed under unless they ate it
right away,” said Jack Todd, Tommy’s second eldest
brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
“Yes, that is one of the difficulties, but I think an
idea that I have borrowed, and am trying now for myself,
may partly solve the trouble. Look ahead of you, close
to the rail fence. What do you see? No; don’t rush to
the fence and trample the snow; keep on the lane side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s some sort of a tent,” said Tommy; “I thought
at first it was just a corn-stack with snow on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; it isn’t a tent,” said Everett Judd, going closer;
“it’s only bean poles stacked with the vines left hanging,
two rows of them, so’s the snow won’t all drift in at one
spot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what else?” asked Gray Lady. “Don’t you see
cracked corn and mill sweepings scattered in between
the poles? This is a feeding-station for our friends,
the game-birds, if we can only make them understand
that it is not a form of trap and does not hold a snare
in disguise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack Todd, who had gone close to the tepee on one
side, stepping on stones that he might avoid tracking
the snow, and was examining the ground intently, suddenly
cried out, “There <span class='it'>have</span> been mill sweepings here,
because I can see some dust, but the grain is all gone,
and I guess—no; I’m <span class='it'>sure</span>—there have been Grouse
about, and they have fed here since snow fell, for there
are tracks coming out from under the fence and going
back the same way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how can you tell that they belong to Grouse?”
asked Gray Lady, coming close to look at the prints and
thinking in her excitement they might have been made
by chickens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they are real Grouse tracks, for they’ve got their
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
spiked snow-shoes on, and here’s the marks of the
prickers!” And Jack pointed to the footprints of the
brushed claws in triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This proves two points,” said Gray Lady, “that
there are Grouse in the neighbourhood, and that they
will take food if it is offered to them in the right way.
I should like to put up a dozen of these feeding-stations,
if you boys will help; you know the woods and brush-lots
better than I do now, and you can select the places
that will be suitable for these shelters and find what
material there is close at hand of which they can be
built.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When this is done, I shall again have to depend upon
you for keeping them supplied with food. If we find
that the grain is eaten, I think that it should be renewed
three times a week, so if six of you boys will volunteer
for the service, two can go together, and it will only make
one trip a week for each pair. If the snow is deep, you
might possibly arrange to fit some boxes to your sleds
to hold food, or, if the shelters are in rough ground,
a bag fastened to the shoulders like a pedler’s pack
might work well; for, in doing this work on a large scale,
merely a pocketful of food will not suffice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will help,” said Jack Todd, after thinking a moment.
“Me, too,” said Everett, and Irving Todd, together; then
of course the others followed, Dave and Tommy anxious
lest they should be left out, while Bobby and little Jared
Hill, though too small to undertake to care for a
station alone, were acceptable as companions for the big
boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have the rest of this week, and all of next for
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>
a holiday,” said Jack Todd, “so suppose we take a
tramp about the hill country on each side of the river
valley to Centreville, that’s about five miles, and fetch
axes with us. I know most of the people on the way,
and, if we put the shelters somewhere near houses, we
could distribute the food along, and they would let us
keep it in one of the outbuildings, so that it would be
handy in stormy weather. I’m pretty sure we can
collect stuff enough as we go for the shelters. My uncle,
who lives at Hilltop Farm, would give me corn-stacks
for three or four. There’s a heap of slab-sides (the
outside strip, with the bark, when a log is to be sawn into
boards) left to go to pieces up by where the sawmill
was last year; they will make fine wigwams, and there
are plenty of cedars and birches, with brushy tops, for
the rest. Then perhaps the folks along the line might
be interested and rig a few up on their own account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Jack,” said Gray Lady, warmly; “you
have caught the spirit of the idea and improved it already,
for if we are to do the game-birds any real good, and
establish the feeding plan permanently, the people all
‘along the line,’ as you call it, must be interested until
not only Fair Meadows township, and the county, but all
the counties in the state, are linked together in the work
of restoration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meanwhile, though, of course, everything that is done
regularly is work, I really envy you boys some of the
fun you will have in your winter tramps; sometimes you
will be able to skate nearly all the way upon the river,
and sometimes, if the snow is as deep as people are predicting,
you may be able to go on snow-shoes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>
“Only I don’t think any of the fellows hereabouts own
a pair of snow-shoes,” said Everett.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then they are the very things for Jacob to help you
make if you come to any of our Saturday meetings,”
said Gray Lady. “Jacob was born in Canada, and
worked with fur trappers for several years, and though,
perhaps, he may not be able to make them as well as
when he was a young man, they would surely be better
than nothing, and who knows but what one of the many
things that the Kind Hearts will organize may be a Snow-shoe
Club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the big boys of Foxes Corner school found themselves
interested and pledged in Gray Lady’s work without
a suspicion of the “playing baby” of which they
had such dread.</p>

<hr class='tbk112'/>

<p class='pindent'>By the time Gray Lady and the boys returned to
Swallow Chimney, the girls had opened their bundles,
and besides little work-boxes, each with a silver thimble
of the right size for the owner, and a pair of scissors that
would “cut clean and not haggle,” as Eliza Clausen expressed
it, there were books for all. Some were about
birds, and others about flowers, trees, butterflies, and
the real life out-of-doors that is more wonderful than
any fairy-tale. Having disposed of their own presents,
with many little shrieks of delight, the girls stood by,
waiting for the boys to open their bundles. These were
all long and flat, with a bunch in the centre, as if two
objects of different shapes were fastened together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy succeeded in untying his first, skeining up the
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
string so that he might have it for the re-wrapping.
A strong, well-made knife, with two blades fell out, and
under it was a hammer, a chisel, a half-inch auger, and
a medium-sized cross-cut saw. Seeing Tommy’s gifts
made the others pull open their packages hastily, with
less regard for string and paper, to find that they also
had the coveted tools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Gray Lady, “you boys will be independent
of your fathers’ tools when you take a bird-house
home to finish, or wish to do a little bit of work for yourselves,
as the girls will also be independent of their
mothers’ work-boxes and thimbles; because, if the grown-up
people are always having their tools borrowed or
mislaid, they are apt to have a sort of grudge against
both the work and the workers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the boys looked at each other rather sheepishly,
and wondered how Gray Lady knew that their fathers
had said that “since the boys took to carpentering there
hadn’t been a hammer or nail to be found nor a saw with
the sign of an edge left on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By and by,” continued Gray Lady, “if you have
the desire, you will all have a chance to earn other tools,
and also make boxes in which to keep them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may wonder why the Christmas tree bore no
candy by way of fruit; that was because part of the fun for
this afternoon will be making candy,—caramels, chocolate
creams, nut taffy, and old-fashioned pulled molasses rope-candy,—so
that, besides the making and tasting, you
will all have something that you have made yourselves
to give the people at home to-morrow, or put in their
stockings if they are hung up. See! here are the boxes
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
that Goldilocks has made to hold the candy!” There
upon a tray were two dozen square boxes covered with
green-and-white paper, and a row of red-paper hearts
pasted across the top of each, with the words, “The Kind
Hearts wish you a Merry Christmas,” printed in red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you make all those boxes yourself, Goldilocks?”
asked Sarah Barnes, in amazement; “I don’t see how
you could turn the corners so nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the boxes; you can buy them for very little at
the factory. I covered them and put the hearts on,
but Mother did the printing. It is easy enough if you
take time. You see the two years that my feet wouldn’t
go, I learned to make my fingers work for both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fire and pans, sugar, molasses, and nuts are all
ready, but, before we become Miss Wilde’s guests and
begin, for the candy-making and supper belong to her
party, we must hold a short business meeting of the
Kind Hearts’ Club, that we may decide how the Christmas
money is to be spent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady then sat down at the end of the room with
Mrs. Wilde, while Goldilocks, the president, took her
place at the head of the long table, with the vice-president,
Miss Wilde, close at hand to prompt. Sarah, the treasurer,
and Tommy, the secretary, were on opposite sides of the
table facing each other, and all the others sat up very
straight, wearing various expressions of importance that
were quite amusing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goldilocks rapped on the table with her pencil, and
said in a rather shaky voice, blushing rosy red as she
spoke, “The meeting will please come to order and
listen to the reading of the minutes of the last meeting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>
There had been but one previous meeting, that to arrange
for the Christmas sale, and it had been informal,
so that this was really the president’s first appearance
in the chair, and, as she spoke, she kept her eyes fastened
to the paper upon which Miss Wilde had written the
order to be followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Secretary will please read the minutes of the last
meeting,” she said, after a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The secretary looked around in a hunted sort of way,
as if to find an open door through which he could escape,
and, seeing none, got rather unsteadily upon his feet,
opened the square blank-book that Gray Lady had
given him for his records, fumbled with the pages, and
then said, rather than read,—“We were all there. We
all agreed to sell the things we’ve been making so as to
get some money to feed birds, and buy things; and Gray
Lady said we could do it in her house; the Saturday before
Christmas was duly appointed, and Dave was to get the
bills, to tell folks it was going to be printed down at the
Chronicle Office, because it is his uncle runs it, and Gray
Lady promised to give cakes and chocolate, in case folks
were hungry.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:8em;'>“Respectfully submitted,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>“<span class='sc'>Thomas Todd, Jr.</span>, Secretary, Amen!”</p>

<hr class='tbk113'/>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady did not dare look at Miss Wilde during
the reading of this report, but the children took it in
perfect earnestness, and Goldilocks, having put the
report to vote, as she had been told, proceeded to the
next item before her and called, “Report of the secretary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Tommy fumbled, and, after looking in every
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>
page of the book but the ones that were written upon,
suddenly burst forth,—“We had it, and we sold everything,
besides some things we haven’t made yet. The
people ate all there was, and took the other things home.
It was a big cinch! Sarah Barnes has got the money
in a box, and her father’s put it in the clock-case, except
some of it that’s in dimes and nickels, and they’re in a bag
in the dresser with the rye meal so’s no one’ll know.
Gray Lady said that to-day we must each bring a paper,
with written on it the way we wanted the money spent.
We have. It was hard to write because some things
we would like to have wouldn’t be nice to everybody
all around, and that’s what it means to have a Kind
Heart, grandma says.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>“Yours truly,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>T. Todd</span>.”</p>

<hr class='tbk114'/>

<p class='pindent'>Action having been taken upon this, and the report
accepted without a dissenting voice, the treasurer was
called upon, and Sarah arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The result of the sale of the Kind Hearts’ Club, which
was held in the spacious residence of Mrs. Gray Lady
Wentworth on Saturday, December 18th, was very gratifying
to all concerned, and the proceeds, fifty dollars, are
now in the hands of the treasurer awaiting the orders
of this august body.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>“Respectfully reported by</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>Sarah Barnes</span>.”</p>

<hr class='tbk115'/>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you get yours together so slick and short,
and full of nice words?” whispered Tommy to Sarah,
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>
across the table, his usual admiration for her now tinged
with new respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t,” she signalled back, not speaking audibly,
but making the words with her lips. “I just told
grandma how much money we had, and she worded it;
they always talked reports that way at the missionary
meetings and sewing societies when she was a girl, and
she thinks folks are getting to be real slack talkers now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dis—cussion is now in order as to the spending
of the money. Will Mr. Todd collect the papers and
the vice-president kindly read them?” said Goldilocks,
after looking at her paper again. And as Tommy passed
a little box for the slips, Gray Lady came from the
corner, so eager was she to hear what the children had
in view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose Wilde opened the papers, and the ideas on the
first few, though good, presented nothing original: food
for birds; books for the school; bird charts for the
Bridgeton Hospital. Sarah’s paper suggested sleigh-rides
and charts for the children in the Bridgeton Orphan
Asylum, “because they don’t know any birds but English
Sparrows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy’s paper read:—“To fix the spring that used
to come down Sugar Loaf Hill into a trough, before Bill
Evans got mad with the Selectmen, and blocked it from
coming through his pasture. There’s no water for drivers
along the road above the Centre until you get to Beaver
Brook, and that’s four miles, unless they get it from our
well, which isn’t handy. My father could fix a big
stone trough, ’cause he’s a mason, and birds and dogs
and horses could drink. Birds need water to mix mud
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>
for their nests, too, especially Robins and Wood Thrushes.
What is wanting, is to pipe the spring across Evans’
field,—his widow’d be pleased to have us; it’s her land.
It’s two hundred feet, father says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a very good, practical idea, Tommy,” said
Gray Lady, earnestly; “we must consider this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose Wilde had now come to the last paper without
discovering anything else of special novelty; this was
written in little Clary’s stiff letters, and filled a whole
sheet of paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t for birds, it’s a blanket for Joel Hanks, the
mail-man’s horse. It’s blind in one eye, and it’s a kind
horse, and knows where all the boxes are. It’s got a
cough now. Mr. Hanks was going to buy a new one (a
blanket), and get shingles on that end of the barn
where the horse stands, so’s the snow won’t drift in,
but his wife got sick last summer, and had doctors and
nurses, and that costs more money than a new horse, and
a whole barn, my mother says. Mother says it isn’t
Joel’s fault he’s poor; he isn’t slack, only some folks
are marked for trouble. Last summer, lightning struck
his haystack, and burned it and only his cornstalks
were left. His horse is thin, too. Cornstalks aren’t
filling for uphill work, my father says, and the mail-route
is all either up or down, and in winter downhill
is slippery, and just as bad. A horse is a lovely animal,
and useful; I would like us to help this horse.
He isn’t a bird, to be sure, but birds have feathers,
and don’t have to drag a wagon uphill, against the wind,
with bent axles. It will take three bundles of shingles
for that barn-end and three lights of window-glass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>
There was silence for a moment, and Miss Wilde, looking
at Gray Lady, while she waited for her to speak, saw
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tommy’s idea about the fountain is excellent, and
I think we can build it before spring, but the blind old
horse and his patient master cannot wait, and they both
serve us, each and all, in fair weather and foul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is it, children? Shall we set aside ten dollars for
the bird food for the winter, and then buy Mr. Hanks
a ton of good hay, a horse-blanket, the three bundles
of shingles, and the window-glass? And do you think
that you big boys could put on the shingles if Jacob
Hughes helped you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can just bet we will!” cried Jack Todd, and
the others nodded approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This matter also was put to vote, and then a committee
appointed, consisting of Miss Wilde and Jack Todd, to
purchase blanket, hay, etc., while to Clary fell the inexpressible
bliss of stopping at Mr. Hanks’ on her way home,
telling him the news, and taking a blanket, warm but
not new, that Gray Lady loaned until the new one could
be had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now for the candy!” shouted Tommy, whose spirits
could keep in no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The meeting isn’t adjourned, yet,” said Goldilocks,
reprovingly, clutching her paper and pounding on the
table. “A motion is in order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I move that we adjourn,” said Miss Wilde.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now somebody say, ‘I second it,’ ” insisted Goldilocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I second it,” came a chorus. And any further remarks
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>
were lost in a shout that arose at the sight of Jim Crow,
climbing along a shelf of the kitchen dresser, with one of
the new pairs of scissors in his beak, that he had managed
to take unobserved from nobody-knew-whose work-basket.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span><h1>XIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BEHIND THE BARS</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Mockingbird, Cardinal, Indigo-bird, and Nonpareil</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>One gray Saturday in January, when the wind rushed
through the trees, making the frozen branches clash
with the sound of metal rather than wood, and it was
too cold to snow, Tommy Todd came to the kitchen
door at “the General’s” carrying a large and unwieldy
bundle carefully wrapt in an old quilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door was opened by Matilda, the old coloured
woman, who had been “the General’s” cook in her youth,
staying on as caretaker during the years when the house
had been closed. “What you got dere, sonny? Sumpin’
live, ’cause I kin hear hit scratchin’. Don’t say yer
bringin’ in a trap o’ rats, ’cause if dere’s anythink I mislike
’ticular, it is dem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, mammy; it isn’t rats, it’s a bird,” said Tommy,
beginning to unwind the quilt which covered a long cage
made of wood and stout wires. When he had succeeded
in freeing it from the cover, which, being ragged, caught
on the wires, he lifted the cage to the kitchen table,
where the light came full upon it. There, hopping nervously
to and fro between the perches, was a gray bird
about the size of a Robin. Its wings and tail had a
browner wash than the rest of its back, while some of
its tail-feathers and its underparts were white, though
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>
now soiled and rather ragged from chafing against the
bars. As it moved about, it whisked its tail to and fro,
in very much the same way as our Catbirds and Brown
Thrashers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matilda adjusted her big spectacles, grumbling as she
did so, “Doan you know, chile, dat Missy doan like birds
to be shet up in cages, and be prisoners, and sole away
from home no mor’n de General would ’low folks to be
shet from liberty an’ traded away? I ’spect she’ll be
powerful mad when she sees dis yere. Whar yeh done
git hit?” Then, as she drew near the cage and saw the
bird plainly, which for a moment stopped its fluttering,
she cried, “For de love ob Heaven, honey! <a id='mock1'></a>it’s a Mocker,
and my ole eyes ain’t seen one since de ole cabin hit burn
down, and we was all scattered out’en, and left Lou’siana
for to git Norf!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My! but what birds dem Mockers were. I kin just
year ’em now.” And Matilda seated herself by the table,
pushed back her glasses, and closed her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Winter wa’n’t well ober ’fore dey began to sing up,
and come peepin’ around de cabins and in de road bushes
lookin’ fer a nest-place. Sometimes dey put it in de thick
bush ober top de swamp, but more times dey put it close
in de rose vines, like as if dey t’ought snakes wouldn’t
likely git ’em dere, ’cause snakes is as set to git Mockers
as de ole one in de garden ob Eden was bound ter git Ebe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat nest, hit was kinder throwed together ob sticks,
but de beddin’ in hit was good an soft, for de Mockers
knew mighty well whar ter find ole cotton fluff to make
a linin’. An’, while all this was doin’, how dey did sing!
Day wasn’t long ’nough fer him, ’cause ’long towards
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>
noon his froat hit git dry and he’d go way down de orange
grove an’ rest him jest a li’l bit, and den come out again
an’ git nearer and nearer to de cabin, an’ when de sun
hit role away to bed an’ de moon-up come, he’d git from
de rose vine to de roof, an’ den up to de chimley edge
an’ sing straight down at yer. Laws, honey, yer couldn’t
never tell in daylight what birds was singin’, de real
ones or him a-mockin’ ob dem. De Red Bird with de
topknot, de Blue Jay, de li’l Wren wif de sassy tail,
de Hangnest (Oriole), or de Blue Sparrow might all
be singin’, for all I know’d, or hit might be only he
a-mockin’ of ’em better than dey knew how demselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when hit come night, and eb’ry one was home
at de quarters, an’ some was singin’, an’ some playin’ de
banjo, an’ de smell from de orange groves risin’ up powerful
on de wind, and sun-down t’ree four hours gone, den
when we heard all dem birds a-singin’, we knew it was de
Mocker, an’ sometimes he wouldn’t stop all the night
until de light hit slip right from silber to gold, an’ den
copper, an’ ’twas sun-up again; an’ in dose days most
eb’ry one had a Mocker in a cage. But here I be runnin’
on ’bout de times when de Lord he let folks an’ wild
birds both be bought an’ sold. Tell me, honey, whar
ye done git him? Shore he neber was flyin’ round about
up yere in de cold an’ snow—him what lubs de sun-up
’way down Lou’siana way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t put him in a cage, Aunt Tilda,” said Tommy,
earnestly; “it is this way. He belonged to old Ned that
works of summers for my Uncle Eph over at Bridgeton,
and then goes home every year down South at Christmas,
to spend the cold weather. This year he has hurt his leg,
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>
and is sick and can’t go, and has to stay in Bridgeton
Hospital. So, as he used to know ‘the General,’ and
he’s heard that Gray Lady loves birds, he told me to
bring his Mocker over here, and ask her if she’d keep it
safe and feed it until real warm spring weather, and
then hang the cage outside, and open the door, and let
it fly away if it would. ’Cause he thinks somehow it
would find the way home if it wants to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He fed it well, and cared for it, and never thought about
its being unhappy in a cage until he had to go to the
hospital, and be shut in, and couldn’t go home South,
perhaps, any more. Then I guess he knew how his
Mocker might feel, too. I think Gray Lady will keep
him, even though it says on the Bird Law posters that
<span class='it'>you mustn’t keep a wild bird dead or alive or have its nest
or eggs</span>. Because if Sheriff Blake arrested her, he knows
old Ned and Gray Lady could explain it all so’s she
wouldn’t be fined.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it that Gray Lady can explain so that she
need not be fined?” said a voice from the store-room on
the other side of the entry way, and “sheself” walked in;
“sheself” being Matilda’s name for her mistress when
she wished to use a term that she considered more dignified
than the homely one of “Missy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Tommy repeated his explanation, while Matilda
stood looking at the Mockingbird and muttering to
herself of the many happenings of her slave days, happy
as well as sad, that the sight of him recalled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I will keep the Mockingbird until spring,”
said Gray Lady, “and then I will hang the cage in the
porch, open the door, but still keep it well supplied with
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
food, so that he may come and go, and if his heart leads
him back towards his southern birthplace, be sure that
he will join the flock of some of his northern kindred
and in their company reach home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do we have any kind of Mockingbird up here?”
asked Tommy, his eyes opening in wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not real brothers of the Mockingbird, though he has
half a dozen in the southwestern part of the country,
but two first cousins, and half a dozen second cousins.
Let us take the Mocker up to the playroom and hang
his cage in the warm window by the chimney, where
the sun will shine on him whenever the clouds let it peep
through. Then I will tell you all who his cousins are,
and about three other American birds that for many
years were caught and kept prisoners in cages and sold
out of their native land.”</p>

<hr class='tbk116'/>

<p class='pindent'>The children were all gathered upstairs by the time
Gray Lady arrived, followed by Tommy, carrying the
cage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a Robin in a cage, once, and a Catbird, and
grandma and Aunt Mary always have Canaries. Why
is it against the law to keep wild birds in cages? That
Mockingbird doesn’t seem to mind it a bit; now that
he’s smoothed down his feathers, and has begun to eat,
he acts real happy,” said Eliza Clausen, after they had
looked at the newcomer and heard the story of his being
sent to Gray Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are two reasons why wild birds should never
be kept in cages except for really scientific study, or
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>
to help them when they are exposed to cold, or are ill
and maimed in some way. The first reason is that when
Nature placed birds in certain localities provided with
the best sorts of beaks, feet, etc., to make them able to
earn their living, it was done because there was work
there for them to do that they could perform better
than anything else. They were a part of the Great Plan
for preventing insect life (which also has its uses) from
increasing too much and doing damage. This is the
practical way of considering birds for what the Wise
Men call their ‘economic value.’ These birds may be
able to hold their own against the birds of prey, that in
the beginning were doubtless made to keep the smaller
birds from becoming too numerous and upsetting the
balance of the Plan, but when man came in, and not only
destroyed them for some fancied damage to his crops,
but took the young from the nest, or trapped the old
birds, and sold them into captivity where they could no
longer follow the creative law, to ‘increase and multiply,’
the danger became grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The second reason, however, is one that our own kind
hearts can understand the best, and that is the misery
of the bird born wild when he feels himself a captive.
If he outlives the first misery, and seems to become
resigned, he may become content in a way, but he can
never forget the liberty he has lost, nor can we, in any
way, make up to him, by mere food and creature-comforts,
the ecstasy of the wild life. The very fact that
the healthful joy of flight and choice in mating is denied
him is enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not realize this when I was a girl, and I also
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
kept cage birds like every one else; it was not because
I was cruel, simply that I had never thought of the
matter any more than my friends, until one day, being
ill and shut in my room, like poor old Ned in the hospital,
<a id='non1'></a>I watched the fluttering of a Painted Bunting or Nonpareil
that my father had bought me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This bird is one of the southern Sparrows, in size no
larger than a Chippy. Its plumage is tropical in its
beauty, deep blue head and neck, red underparts, glistening
green back, green-and-red wings, with a reddish
tail; in short, a glittering opal copied in feathers. Its
cage was roomy, and it had the best of food, and fresh
water for bathing and drinking, while the shelf in the
window, on which it stood, was filled with flowering plants,
up through the branches of which it could look. But,
oh, the expression of that bird’s body! I watched its
every motion; the head thrown backward, searching in
vain for a loophole of escape between the bars, the
quivering of its wings as the impulse for freedom, and
the company of its kind, swept over it! Sometimes,
late in the night, when I awoke and looked toward it,
I could see that it was awake and its wings trembling
with the thought of dawn that it could not fly to meet.
Then I knew, even if it became cowed, and forgot its
natural instincts so far as to be dumbly content as a
prisoner, that the real life of the bird would be as dead
as if a bullet had ended it, and though it was late winter,
February, I felt that I must give it liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told my father, and he sympathized with me as usual,
listened to my story, and then, packing the cage safely,
had it sent by special express to a family friend, who was
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>
wintering in Florida, with the request that she liberate
the prisoner. For, as we could not get it to its winter
haunt in the tropics, this seemed next best, and it would
soon meet the flocks of its kin on the return trip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So the bird was freed, and once more felt the joy of
being lifted on his wings whither he would go, and whatever
loneliness he may have suffered after that, he had
gained liberty, which is the right of the least of God’s
creatures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of the four American birds that were most commonly
caged, the Mockingbird and Cardinal have always
been the most popular, and this is what some of the
writers have said about taking them into captivity.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>The Mockingbird</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='mock2'></a>The Mockingbird ranges from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
and from middle Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania, southward
to the Gulf of Mexico. Usually the bird-hunters take the young
from the nest as soon as they open their beaks for food. These
are sold in Southern cities by negro boys for from fifteen to
twenty-five cents apiece.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thousands of Mockingbirds find
their way across the Atlantic.”—<span class='sc'>Henry Nehrling</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is one of our most common cage-birds and is very
generally known, not only in North America, but even in Europe,
numbers of them having been carried over both to France and
England, in which last country they are called ‘Virginia Nightingales.’ ”—<span class='sc'>Alexander

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>The Indigo-bird</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“The combination of musical ability, lovely plumage, and its
seed-eating qualities long since has made the Indigo Bunting in
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>
danger of extermination, through the fact of its being universally
captured throughout the South and sold as a cage-bird, both for
home use and for export.”</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<h2 class='nobreak'><a id='non2'></a><span class='it'>Painted Bunting or Nonpareil</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“This splendid, gay, and docile bird, known to Americans as
the Nonpareil (the unequalled), and to the French Louisianans as
<span class='it'>le pape</span>, inhabits the woods of the low countries of the Southern
states.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the sake of their song as well as beauty of plumage they
are commonly domesticated in the houses of the French inhabitants
of New Orleans and its vicinity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are commonly caught in trap-cages, to which they are
sometimes allured by a stuffed bird, which they descend to attack;
and they have been known to live in captivity for upwards
of ten years.”—<span class='sc'>Thomas Nuttall</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The Mockingbird, as you see, has sombre gray
plumage like his cousin, the Catbird, that we all know so
well that I think he should drop a name that belies
his wonderful musical ability, and be called the ‘Northern
Mockingbird.’ Even though the Mocker is caged, you
can see the resemblance, in the way in which he twitches
his tail, and first throws back his beak and then looks
sideways, to our merry singer of the garden who often
makes us think that half a dozen birds are perching in
the drying-yard when he sits upon the top of a clothes-pole
and lets his imagination float away with his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Brown Thrasher, too, with the long, curved beak,
brown back, and speckled breast, is also a first cousin
and has the Mockingbird habit of mounting high up
when he sings and looking straight up at the sky; while
the Wrens, one and all, belong to this famous family group
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>
and come in, we may say, as second cousins, and like
the Mockingbird, aside from the beauty of song, are
very valuable insect eaters. The other three birds have
the conical beak that stamps them as members of the
family of Finches and Sparrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='indigo1'></a>Rich colour is the chief attribute that sets the Indigo
Bunting apart from its kin of the tribe of
Sparrows and Finches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blue that is decided in tone, and not a bluish gray,
is one of the rarest hues among the birds of temperate
zones; for one may count the really blue birds of the
eastern United States upon the fingers of one hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Bunting belongs to the tree-loving and tree-nesting
part of his tribe, in company with the Grosbeaks,
and the brilliant yellow American Goldfinch,
whose black cap, wings, and tail-feathers only enhance
his beauty. The Sparrows, of sober stripes, nest on or
near the ground, and their plumage blends with brown
grass, twigs, and the general earth-colouring, illustrating
very directly the theory of colour protection, while
the birds of brilliant plumage invariably keep more
closely to the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In size the Indigo Bunting ranks with the small Sparrows,
coming in grade between the Field- and the Song Sparrows,
and being only slightly larger than the Chippy.
The female wears a modification of the Sparrow garb,
the upper parts being ashy brown without stripes, the
underparts grayish white, washed and very faintly
streaked with dull brown, the wings and tail-feathers having
some darker edges and markings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When it comes to painting the plumage of the male in
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>
words, the task becomes difficult; for to use simply the
term indigo-blue is as inadequate as to say that a bit of
water that looks blue while in shadow, is of the same colour
when it ripples out into full sunlight and catches a dozen
reflections from foliage and sky. A merely technical
description would read: Front of head and chin rich
indigo-blue, growing lighter and greener on back and underparts;
wings dusky brown, with blue edges to coverts;
tail-feathers also blue edged; bill and feet dark; general
shape rounded and canary-like, resembling the Goldfinch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The last of May one of these Buntings came to a low
bush, outside my window, and, after resting awhile, for
the night before had been stormy, dropped to the closely
cut turf to feed upon the crumbs left where the hounds
had been munching their biscuits. I have never seen a
more beautiful specimen, and the contrast with the vivid
grass seemed to develop the colour of malachite that ran
along one edge of the feathers, shifting as the bird moved
like the sheen of changeable silk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The nest, in no wise typical, is a loose and rather careless
structure of grass, twigs, horsehairs, roots, or bits
of bark placed in a low, scrubby tree or bush at no great
distance from the ground, and the eggs are a very pale
blue or bluish white, and only three or four in number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Being a seed-eater, it is undoubtedly this Bunting’s
love of warmth that gives him so short a season with us:
for he does not come to the New England states until the
first week in May, and, after the August moult, when he
dons the sober clothing of his mate, he begins to work
southward by the middle of September,—those from the
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
most northerly portions of the breeding range, which
extends northward to Minnesota and Nova Scotia, having
passed by the tenth of October. He winters in Central
America and southward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Although of the insect-eating fraternity of the conical
beak, the Indigo Bunting consumes many noxious insects
in the nesting season, when the rapid growth of the
young demands animal food, no matter to what race
they belong. Being an inhabitant of the overgrown
edges of old pastures, or the brushy fences of clearings
and pent roads, he is in a position where he can do a
great deal of good. Mr. Forbush, in his valuable book on
<span class='it'>Useful Birds and Their Protection</span>, credits the Indigo
Bunting with being a consumer of the larvæ of the mischievous
brown-tail moth; but whatever service it may do
as an insect destroyer, its service the year through as
a consumer of weed seeds, in common with the rest of its
tribe, is beyond dispute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The voice of the Indigo Bunting is pretty rather than
impressive, and varies much in individuals. It consists
of a series of hurried, canary-like notes repeated constantly
and rising in key, but, to my mind, never reaching the
dignity of being called impressive song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nuttall, one of the early American Wise Men, writes
that, though usually shy, the Indigo-bird, during the season,
is more frequently seen near habitations than in remote
thickets: ‘Their favourite resort is the garden, where,
from the topmost branch of some tall tree that commands
the whole wide landscape, the male regularly pours out
his lively chant and continues it for a considerable length
of time. Nor is this song confined to the cool and animating
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>
dawn of morning, but it is renewed, and still more
vigorous, during the noonday heat of summer. This
lively strain is composed of a repetition of short notes,
which, commencing loud and rapid, and then slowly
falling, descend almost to a whisper, succeeded by a silence
of almost half a minute, when the song is again continued
as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘In the village of Cambridge (Massachusetts), I have
seen one of these azure, almost celestial musicians, regularly
chant to the inmates of a tall dwelling-house from
the summit of the chimney or the tall fork of the lightning-rod.
I have also heard a Canary repeat and imitate
the low lisping trill of the Indigo-bird, whose warble,
indeed, often resembles that of this species.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This combination of musical ability, lovely plumage,
and its seed-eating qualities long since has made the
Indigo Bunting in danger of extermination, through the
fact of its being universally, throughout the South, captured
and sold as a cage-bird, both for home use and for
export. In that section the bird is called the ‘blue pop,’
a corruption of ‘bleu pape,’ or ‘pope,’ of the French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <a id='card3'></a>Cardinal, called ‘Grosbeak’ from the thickness and
size of its bill, is of course a very conspicuous bird wherever
seen, and therefore has always been a mark for
the ‘arrow of death,’ as Mr. Allen, who knows
this bird in its native haunts, and its every mood, puts it.
Some day when you are older you will read his story of it
as it lives in the deep recesses of the evergreen woods,
called <span class='it'>The Kentucky Cardinal</span>. For though this bird is
found nesting as far north as Central Park, New York,
and it has once or twice come to my garden here, and
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
gone into Massachusetts even, in the fall roving-time, we
must always associate him with a long outdoor season
and sunny skies, as we do the Mockingbird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the Mocker suffered for his voice, the Cardinal was
made a prisoner for his song and gorgeous colour combined,
and though, as is bird law in such cases, the female is dull
in colour, she has a very attractive song also, even in confinement.
But I hope that these prison days are over.
Whoever now confines the Cardinal is a law-breaker as
well as a heart-breaker, and yet, but ten years ago, every
bird-store window was aglow with the colour of the Cardinal’s
mantle. I have here in the scrap-book a charming
story that you will like to hear, of a Cardinal in Boston,
made a temporary captive for its own preservation, and of
its release when the right time came.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE CARDINAL AT THE HUB</h2>

<p class='pindent'>His range being southern, Cardinal Grosbeak seldom
travels through New England; and, to my knowledge, has
never established a home and reared a family north of
Connecticut until in the instance here recorded. Kentuckians
claim him, and with some show of right, since
James Lane Allen built his monument in imperishable
prose. But, soon or late, all notables come to Boston,
and among them may now be registered the “Kentucky
Cardinal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shy by nature, conspicuous in plumage, he shuns publicity;
and avoiding the main lines of travel, he puts up
at a quiet country house in a Boston suburb—Brookline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, one October day in 1897, among the migrants
stopping at this halfway house, appeared a distinguished
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
guest, clad in red, with a black mask, a light red bill, and
a striking crest; with him a bird so like him that they
might have been called the two Dromios. After a few
days the double passed on, and left our hero the only red-coat
in the field. A White-throated Sparrow now arrived
from the mountains, and a Damon-and-Pythias friendship
sprang up between the birds. Having decided to winter
at the North, they took lodgings in a spruce tree, and
came regularly to the <span class='it'>table d’hôte</span> on the porch. My lord
Cardinal, being the more distinguished guest, met with
particular favour, and soon became welcome at the homes
of the neighbourhood. With truly catholic taste, he
refused creature-comforts from none, but showed preference
for his first abode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was March 5, 1898, when we kept our first appointment
with the Cardinal. A light snow had fallen during
the night, and the air was keen, without premonition of
spring. It was a day for home-keeping birds, the earth
larder being closed. The most delicate tact was required
in presenting strangers. A loud, clear summons—the
Cardinal’s own whistle echoed by human lips—soon
brought a response. Into the syringa bush near the porch
flew, with a whir and a sharp <span class='it'>tsip</span>, a bird. How gorgeous
he looked in the snow-laden shrub! For an instant the
syringa blossoms loaded the air with fragrance as a dream
of summer floated by. Then a call to the porch was met
by several sallies and quick retreats, while the wary bird
studied the newcomers. Reassuring tones from his gentle
hostess, accompanied by the rattle of nuts and seeds,
at last prevailed, and the Cardinal flew to the railing, and
looked us over with keen, inquiring eye. Convinced that
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
no hostilities were intended, he gave a long, trustful look
into the face of his benefactress and flew to her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gray squirrel, frisking by, stopped at the lunch-counter
and seized an “Educator” cracker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The novel sensation of an uncaged bird within touch,
where one might notice the lovely shading of his plumage
as one notes a flower, was memorable; but a sweeter
surprise was in store. As we left the house, having made
obeisance to his eminence, the Cardinal, the bird flew into
a spruce tree and saluted us with a melodious “Mizpah.”
Then, as if reading the longing of our hearts, he opened
his bright bill, and a song came forth such as never before
enraptured the air of a New England March,—a song so
copious, so free, so full of heavenly hope, that it seemed
as if forever obliterated were the “tragic memories of his
race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As March advanced, several changes in the Cardinal were
noted by his ever-watchful friends. He made longer trips
abroad, returning tired and hungry. The restlessness of
the unsatisfied heart was plainly his. His long, sweet,
interpolating whistle, variously rendering “Peace .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
peace .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. peace!” “Three cheers, three cheers,” etc.,
to these sympathetic northern ears became “Louise,
Louise, Louise!” Thenceforth he was Louis, the Cardinal,
calling for his mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On March 26, a kind friend took pity on the lonely
bachelor, and a caged bird, “Louise,” was introduced to
him. In the lovely dove-coloured bird, with faint washings
of red, and the family mask and crest, the Cardinal at
once recognized his kind. His joy was unbounded, and
the acquaintance progressed rapidly, a mutual understanding
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>
being plainly reached during the seventeen days
of cage courtship. Louis brought food to Louise, and
they had all things in common, except liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>April 12, in the early morning, the cage was taken out-of-doors,
and Louise was set free. She was quick to embrace
her chance, and flew into the neighbouring shrubbery.
For six days she revelled in her new-found freedom,
Louis, meanwhile, coming and going as of old, and often
carrying away seeds from the house to share with his
mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>April 16, he lured her into the house, and after that
they came often for food, flying fearlessly in at the window,
and delighting their friends with their songs and
charming ways. Louis invariably gave the choicest
morsels to his mate, and the course of true love seemed to
cross the adage; but, alas! Death was already adjusting
an arrow for that shining mark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>April 25, Louise stayed in the house all day, going out
at nightfall. Again the following day she remained indoors,
Louis feeding her; but her excellent appetite disarmed
suspicion, and it was thought that she had taken
refuge from the cold and rain, especially as she spent the
night within. The third morning, April 27, she died. An
examination of her body showed three dreadful wounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louis came twittering to the window, but was not let
in until a day or two later, when a new bird, “Louisa,”
had been put in the cage. When he saw the familiar
form, he evidently thought his lost love restored, for he
burst into glorious song; but, soon discovering his mistake,
he stopped short in his hallelujahs, and walked
around the cage inspecting the occupant.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>
Louisa’s admiration for the Cardinal was marked; but
for some days he took little notice of her, and his friends
began to fear that their second attempt at match-making
would prove a failure. April 30, however, some responsive
interest was shown, and the next day Louis brought
to the cage a brown bug, half an inch long, and gave Louisa
his first meat-offering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second wooing progressed rapidly, and May 7, when
Louisa was set free, the pair flew away together with unrestrained
delight. After three days of liberty, Louisa
flew back to the house with her mate, and thenceforth was
a frequent visitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May 21, Louisa was seen carrying straws, and on June 6
her nest was discovered low down in a dense evergreen
thorn. Four speckled eggs lay in the nest. These were
hatched June 9, the parent birds, meantime and afterward,
going regularly to market, and keeping up social relations
with their friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In nine days after their exit from the shell, the little
Cardinals left the nest and faced life’s sterner realities.
A black cat was their worst foe, and more than once,
during their youth, Louis flew to his devoted commissary
and made known his anxiety. Each time, on following
him to the nest, she found the black prowler, or one of his
kind, watching for prey. On June 28, the black cat outwitted
the allied forces, Señor Cardinal and his friends,
and a little one was slain. The other three grew up, and
enjoyed all the privileges of their parents, flying in at
the window, and frequenting the bountiful porch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>July 25, Louisa disappeared from the scene, presumably
on a southern trip, leaving the Cardinal sole protector,
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>
provider, and peacemaker for their lively and quarrelsome
triplet. A fight is apparently as needful for the
development of a young Cardinal as of an English schoolboy,
possibly due in both cases to a meat diet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overfeeding was but temporary with our birds. On
the 8th of August the migratory instinct prevailed over
ease, indulgence, friendship, and the Cardinal with his
brood left the house, where he had been so well entertained,
to return no more. No more? Who shall say of
any novel that it can have no sequel? Massachusetts may
yet become the permanent home of the Kentucky Cardinal,
the descendant to the third and fourth generation of Louis
and his mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Gray Lady read the story of the Cardinal, the children,
between listening to it and being intent on their
work, forgot the Mockingbird in the window, upon whom
the rays of the sun, that had gradually managed to pierce
the clouds, were resting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As her mother finished and paused, Goldilocks, with a
very slight gesture, directed their glance toward the window,
where the <a id='mock3'></a>Mockingbird, having completed his toilet and
meal, perched, wings slightly raised and quivering, with
half-closed eyes, murmuring a few broken snatches of song,
half to himself and half as if in a dream, his head thrown
back and, oh, such a human expression of longing in his
attitude, that Gray Lady, without speaking, turned the
leaves of her scrap-book slowly until she came to a place
where the long line of prose shortened to verse, and then
in a low but distinct voice she read:—</p>

It was very still for a moment, and something fell on
Sarah Barnes’ work that was bright, but it wasn’t a needle!
Then, looking across at the cage, but addressing Gray
Lady, she said, “We’ve paid for the shingles, and the hay,
and the horse-blanket, and a chest-protector, besides, for
the horse to wear all the time, to keep the uphill wind off
his lungs. We’ve bought the bags of sweepings for the
feeding-places, and there’s three dollars and eighty-five
cents left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t the Kind Hearts’ Club have a meeting <span class='it'>right
away</span>, and vote to send Old Ned’s <a id='mock4'></a>Mocker back down South
by express, <span class='it'>now</span>, before he, maybe, dies, so’s he’d be there
to meet spring, even if old Ned can’t? Then he’d have
time to look up a mate in case his old one has got tired of
waiting for him,” she added in a more cheerful tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady said that, as all the members were present,
a special meeting would be in order; and two days later
the Mockingbird started for the southern home of one of
Gray Lady’s school friends, with a “special” tag on his
well-wrapped cage and a bottle of extra food fastened
outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, the untold misery and waste of this caging and
selling of free-born birds! It is only one grade less direct
a slaughter than killing them to trim a bonnet. While
the sufferings of the bonnet-bird end at once, with its
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
life, those of the caged bird have only begun as the door
closes behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few exceptional cases, where birds in care of those who
are both able and willing to make their surroundings
endurable, count as nothing against the general condemnation
of the practice of caging birds born wild.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those of us who have known, by experience, in caring for
wounded or sick birds, exactly what incessant watchfulness
is necessary to keep them alive, realize how impossible
it is that this care should be given them by the
average purchaser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Birds born and reared in captivity, like the Canary,
are the only ones that real humanity should keep behind
bars. There is no more condemnable habit than taking
nestlings of any kind, and trying to rear them, unless
disaster overtakes the parents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nominally, the traffic in caged wild birds has ceased;
actually, it has not; nor will it until every bird-lover
feels himself responsible for staying the hand that would
rob the nest, whether it is that of the ignorant little
pickaninny of the South, who climbs up the vine outside
the window where you are wintering, and sees, in the four
young Mockers, in the nest just under the sill, a prospective
dollar; the child at home, who likes to experiment for a
few days with pets, and then forgets them; or the wily
dealer, who sells secretly what he dares not exhibit. No
quarter to any class who make prisoners of the wild, outside
of the zoölogical gardens or the few private outdoor
aviaries, where the proper conditions exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Any free citizen prefers death to loss of liberty, and
even the most material mind will, at least, allow this
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>
human quality to Citizen Bird, while it proves that he or
she who either cages or buys the captive wholly lacks
the spiritual quality.</p>

These were the hard days for birds and people both,
days of sleet and ice, when the snow seemed to chill and
bind the trees down, instead of winding lovely draperies
about them as it did at first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toward the end of January the cedar-berries gave out,
and the juicy blackberries of the honeysuckle, that clings
to everything that will hold the vines, became watery and
poor; most of the seed-stalks of weeds were beaten down,
and it was “mighty poor picking for birds,” as Sarah
Barnes expressed the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lunch-counter in Birdland received a fresh supply
of food every morning, and yet, sometimes before dark,
every grain had been eaten, and the generous lumps of
suet picked to shreds. The feeding-stations for the game-birds
all had visitors, and the boys, who kept them supplied,
saw, in their walks, many winter birds that they
never before knew came so near to the cultivated farmland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Acting on the general idea of feeding and sheltering
birds that now seemed to pervade the air of Fair Meadows
township, many people scattered food on the roofs of
their sheds, and made openings in their corn-stacks, or left
a window of the hay-barn ajar, where birds might seek a
shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through the month the resident winter birds were
seen at intervals. Of course, there would be many days
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>
when no birds would appear, and it would seem as if they
had all gone, but let the sun shine, and the least breath
of wind blow from the southeast, and they would come out
of the near-by shelter where they had been hiding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The orchard lunch-counter was the one place where, at
least, a single bird was always to be found, and, at times,
as many as half a dozen different kinds would be seen
feeding peaceably together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady kept a list of all the birds that the children
reported, and sometimes it was quite a puzzle for her to
name a bird, unknown to the discoverer, from the description
that was brought of it. For to see the chief points of
a bird at a glance is difficult enough in itself, but to put
them into exact words seemed sometimes impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Dave, on his return from a sleigh-ride to the
shore, said that he’d seen a “big round-headed Owl
sitting on a stump in the salt meadows, and it looked as
if it had sat out all night in a snow-squall,” Gray Lady
knew at once that he had seen one of the Arctic or <a id='snowyowl'></a><a id='snowy'></a>Snowy
Owls that occasionally drift down from the North on a
short visit, and that it was on the lookout for a meal of
meadow-mice or other little gnawers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when Bobbie, who went to the same location, reported
that he had seen “a flock of birds that were sort of
Sparrows with a yellow breast, and a black mark on it,
and long ears,” it took a little time and many questions
before she found that the birds were visiting Horned
Larks, with pinkish brown backs, a black crescent on the
breast, and a black bar across the forehead, that, extending
around the sides of the head, forms two little tufts, or
feather horns. For the rest, the throat and neck were dull
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>
yellow, and the underparts white streaked with black.
These birds were little known. They only made flying
visits, and gave merely a call-note, keeping their beautiful
song, during which they soar in the air like the Sky-lark,
for their nesting-haunts in the far North.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady’s ingenuity was taxed to its utmost, however,
when one Saturday morning little Clary came to the playroom,
her face aglow, and said that she had seen “a brown
Blue Jay with a yellow tail and red wings; not just one,
but a whole family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Gray Lady was quite at a loss how to
proceed; yellow tail and red wings were surely startling;
then she saw that there must be some point about the bird
that reminded the child of a Jay other than its colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did this bird look like a Jay, Clary?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the head,” came the prompt reply; “it had feathers
on top that moved up and down, the way a Jay’s does, and
it was dark in the nose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On thinking over the winter birds that had a crest of
feathers that could be raised or lowered, she realized that
the Cedar-bird had such a one, also a black beak, and
a black eye-stripe that made it look “dark in the nose,”
but yellow tail and red wings it certainly did not have,
merely a narrow yellow band on the tail and small,
waxen, coral-red tips to some of the wing quills. However,
taking half a dozen coloured pictures from one of the
portfolios that she kept at hand to settle disputed points,
she spread them in front of the little girl, who, without
a moment’s hesitation, picked out the Cedar-bird, or Cedar
Waxwing, as it is properly called from its coral wings-tips.</p>

In common with all winter birds, its movements are
guided by the food supply, and if severe cold and heavy
snows drive away the small birds, and bury the mice
upon which it feeds, the Shrike must necessarily rove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grasshoppers, beetles, other large insects, and field-mice
are staple articles of its food in seasons when they
are obtainable; in fact, next to insects, mice constitute
the staple article of its diet; and protection should be
accorded it on this account, even though we know the
Shrike chiefly as the killer of small birds. The victims are
caught by two methods: sneaking,—after the fashion of
Crows,—and dropping upon them suddenly from a
height, like the small Hawks. In the former case the
Shrikes frequent clumps of bushes, either in open meadows
or gardens, lure the little birds by imitating their call-notes,
and then seize them as soon as they come within
range. They often kill many more birds than they can
possibly eat at a meal, and hang them on the spikes of a
thorn or on the hooks of a cat-brier in some convenient
spot, until they are needed, in the same manner as a butcher
hangs his meat; and from this trait the name “Butcher-bird”
was given them.</p>

<hr class='tbk119'/>

<p class='pindent'>During some of these wintry days of meeting, questions
and answers about the birds seen filled the time, and then
Gray Lady read to them from some of her many books
what people living in other places had said and thought of
these same familiar birds. Besides the stories, she told
them many things about the building of a bird, its bones,
its feathers, the reasons why of the various kinds of feet
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
and bills, the grouping of race, tribe, and family that both
divide the bird world and at the same time bind it together;
for she very well knew that when spring came with its
procession of songsters, the children would be so eager to
listen, see, follow, and learn the names of the living birds
that they would not have patience to listen to the dry
details.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span><h1>XXI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>JACOB HUGHES’ OPINION OF CATS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>One morning after a light snow-storm, followed by
sparkling sunshine, Gray Lady took the younger children
out for a walk through Birdland and the lane. Not but
what even the younger children knew the way! But often
as they had trodden it, there were many things that they
noticed for the first time: the wonderful shapes of the
snow crystals, the snow flowers that blossomed on the old
weed stalks, the snow filling that brought many hidden
nests into view, and all the other wonders that are so often
wrought in the winter night, while we sleep soundly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy and Dave, who had walked on ahead, halted
suddenly and picked up a handful of feathers from the
snow and stood looking at them as Gray Lady came up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bad Hawk or a Crow or Owl or something big has
been here,” said Dave, with a quaver in his voice, “and
it’s killed a banty rooster that looks just like mine, that
is, this bunch of feathers does; but then, Goldilocks has
banties, too, so perhaps it is one of hers,” and he held the
feathers up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady took them; yes, they were banty feathers,
and from a bird that had not been long dead, for the quill
ends were still moist. Then she looked at the ground:
“Something that did not fly has killed the bantam, and
dragged its body along the ground, and it had feet with
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>
padded claws, look!” she said, and there was a blood-stained
trail that skirted the bushes and then ran
across the lane toward a hay-barn that now held only
bedding and cornstalks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You children amuse yourselves here while Tommy,
Dave, and I follow this up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing could have been more simple than this following,
as the footprints of the large cat, for that is what it
was, showed plainly in the new snow, and, here and there,
a few drops of blood also marked the way. Straight to
the barn ran the trail, and then through a small door that
had been left open at Gray Lady’s request, that birds
might take shelter inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they had, poor things, and so had the cat also. On
the floor were other feathers of many kinds, among which
Gray Lady recognized the white-spotted tail-feathers of a
Robin, the pointed shafts of the Flicker, and gray-and-white
down that might have come from a Junco’s breast;
while half hidden by loose cornstalks was the foot of a
Grouse, also yellow legs that had belonged to a good-sized
chicken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys stood still in amazement, and Dave said, “I
knew foxes and dogs carried things home or buried them,
but I didn’t know cats did unless they have kittens hidden.
I wonder if there are kittens in the cornstalks, and if this
cat stole all the chickens we’ve been losing every day
almost along since fall? Because it couldn’t be any kind
of birds that stole them, they couldn’t get in; and father
said it lay between cats, rats, and weasels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will soon find out,” said Gray Lady. “Will you
boys go down to the stable and ask Jacob to come up?
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>
I will watch here.” As soon as they had gone, Gray Lady
went into a corner and seated herself upon a box. Presently
she heard a rustle among the cornstalks and out
stalked a great tiger-striped cat, licking her whiskers.
After snuffing the footsteps of the boys, she began to lash
her tail to and fro, which in a cat means anger, and quite
the reverse of the dog’s sociable, “I’m glad to see you”
tail-wag. Then, looking back at the hole in the corn stack
through which she had come, she made a strange sound,
half purr, half growl, that Gray Lady thought was evidently
intended as a note of warning, and then the cat
slunk off through the snow, keeping as close to the fence
as possible and dropping her body low as she hurried
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Jacob came, he took a hayfork and began to shift
the cornstalks from the corner to the empty floor opposite.
The feathers, he said, had all been gathered during the
two past weeks, for when he had last taken the wood-sled
from the barn, no feathers were to be seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here they are!” he exclaimed, as the last stack was
reached, but even as he spoke, six half-grown kittens,
brindled like their parent, sprang in different directions,
some going up on the beams and others diving into the
hay, only one remaining, with arched back and flashing
eyes, to hiss a protest at the disturbing of their comfortable
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use of making bird laws and feeding birds
and all that, and letting wild beasts like these multiply
about the country?” said Jacob, resting on the handle of
the fork. “<span class='it'>No, ma’am</span>, if I had my way, I’d get up a
Kind Heart Club of men to help the birds and rid the
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>
township of homeless cats, red squirrels, and English
Sparrows—yes, I would, ma’am!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have eyes and I use them, and I know cats are worse
enemies to birds, counting wild birds and poultry together,
than everything else that walks or flies humped together.
Tame house cats are bad enough, for they’ll kill for pleasure
when they’re not hungry. My sister over at Hill’s farm
says she’s taken over fifty dead or half-dead birds away
from her pet cat this summer, until it sickened her of the
idea of keeping cats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But when it comes to the half-breeds that some folks
let grow up because they’re too slack to kill ’em, it’s just
a crime! Look at this piece of work here; the cat that
has done all this is one of the outcasts of the lot down at
the grist-mill. Cats are only half tamed at best; let them
get a taste of hunting and back they go and are savages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They don’t belong to this country; we folks brought
’em, like we did English Sparrows, and we made a mistake,
and we ought to undo it when we can. Transplanted
animals, like pauper foreigners, always get the upper hand.
Traps can catch up the rats and mice, only we’re too lazy
to set them. Cats are no good, even for pets, for they’re
tricky, and they aren’t healthy for children to have
because they carry skin diseases and such in their fur.
They claim that Jessie Lyons that died in Bridgeton ’long
in the fall got the diphtheria from her cat’s trampin’ all
over creation, and then her huggin’ it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it’s right and proper to license dogs, and if one kills
fowls or sheep, for the town to pay damages, then, say
I, the least we can do is to license cats and hold the owners
for their mischief.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span>
“Next to cats I’m most put out with red squirrels and
English Sparrows. The first are sneaks; they take eggs,
little birds, and all. They make free with young gray
squirrels, too, and don’t spare their next-door neighbours
even, while Sparrows hustle and do much likewise, taking
the nesting-places of Swallows and Bluebirds and Jenny
Wrens, and fighting and wrastling with anything smaller
than themselves, breaking up nests and pitching out young
ones until I just can’t stand it! Now it’s woe to any of
these three that comes across my path. Maybe some
folks will say I’m cruel. Will those folks let mice and
rats eat their groceries and not kill them? and by themselves
rats and mice are decent, clean animals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not they; and to us that love our tree birds, cats and
red squirrels and English Sparrows are hateful as are rats
and mice, and I warrant you’ll not think I’m going too
far when I say it, ma’am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Jacob, you are right, though I’m sorry to say so,”
answered Gray Lady, still looking at the feathers. “The
cat tribe is by nature cruel. All animals kill for food,
but the cat tortures before she kills. I used to defend the
keeping of pet cats until one that I had trusted bit me
through the hand at a moment when I was petting her,
without the slightest provocation. I never knew a dog to
bite his master unprovoked—unless he was ill—and
even if we love our cats, we should be unselfish, for birds
are of value to the country at large and cats are not.
Only, I insist upon this, that the killing, even of vermin,
is a matter for the grown-up, and some one with authority
should be appointed to do it. It should not be left to the
young and irresponsible, just as the punishing of human
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>
criminals is not a matter for the people in general to decide
and put in execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, boys,” Gray Lady continued, “I wish every one
would feel responsible in this matter. No farmer will
raise more poultry or calves or colts than he can feed
and then turn them loose to either starve or prey upon
his neighbours. Why, then, should he allow his cats to
straggle about and kill the song-birds that even much
money cannot buy or replace? But come, we must go
on; the others will be wondering where we are.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you all to look at something at the lane end,—that
great beech tree with the gray streaked trunk. Do
you see the sunbeams playing checkers on the bark, this
side? Do you know what this means? I will tell you.
It means that the tide of winter is turning toward spring,
that February is here. We should not know it unless we
looked at the day in the calendar. It is quite as cold as
it has been all through the winter, but the days are growing
longer, and now, once more, the sun slips by the barn in
the morning and lies upon the beech trunk that has
been in shadow all winter long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father showed me this when I was a child; and
whenever I grew tired of winter, the earth seemed dead,
and it seemed as if spring would never come back, he would
say, ‘Go up the lane and see if the sun’s message is written
on the beech tree.’ So, while it is still winter here, down
in the South the flocks of Robins and Song Sparrows and
Bluebirds are reading the sun’s message, and, far away
as spring seems, they are planning their return. Meanwhile
we have the brave winter birds to keep us cheerful.
<a id='junc2'></a>See the flock of Juncoes alighting yonder. They are as
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>
plump and freshly plumed as new arrivals in spring dress.
This Snowbird is no sloven, he always wears a trim dress-suit.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span><h1>XXII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>FEBRUARY, “THE LONG-SHORT MONTH”</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Bluebird, <a id='song2'></a>Song Sparrow, Robin</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder why February is so long, when it is the
very shortest month in the year?” said Goldilocks one
Saturday, as she and Miss Wilde were walking from
Swallow Chimney, up through Birdland, to the big house
for the bird class.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have often thought the same thing myself,” answered
Rose Wilde, “and I think it must be because, knowing
that it is a short month, we think spring is hurrying to us
because we are trying to hurry toward it. Spring, however,
never hurries to return to New England, even when
nature faces her this way she seems to take pleasure in
walking backward!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Wilde and Goldilocks had become fast friends since
the little teacher had come to live on the hill. With the
interest Gray Lady had shown in the children and school,
the dreary, lonely days had passed away, and she no
longer looked pale and nervous, but was bright-eyed, with
a lovely soft colour in her cheeks, so that, as Goldilocks
told her one day, her name could be written in two ways,
Rose Wilde, and Wild Rose, which, of course, made her
blush with pleasure, and look all the more like that
radiant June flower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goldilocks would have liked to go to school at Foxes
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>
Corners with the others, but the doctor shook his head
and said something to her mother about “unwholesome
stove heat, fresh air but not draughts,” but Gray Lady
smiled at Goldilocks with a mysterious sort of glance that
always hid a surprise and said, “Be content to grow strong
this winter and wait and see what will happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but Miss Wilde may go to a better school next
year, if she is well, for you know that Sarah Barnes’
grandmother heard that she had two chances, one at the
Bridgeton High School and one to teach the eighth grade
at the Centre. Besides, the children I like best—Sarah,
and Tommy, and Dave, and Eliza—won’t be at Foxes
Corners next year. If their parents can take turns in lending
them a horse, they will have to go to the Centre
School for the eighth grade, because no one can go from
Foxes Corners straight into the High School, and they do
<span class='it'>so</span> want to learn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it is quite possible that Rose Wilde may go
to another school, and we would not wish to keep her back,
I’m sure, little daughter.” Something in Gray Lady’s
voice made Goldilocks look at her quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t guess what it is, motherkin, but I simply <span class='it'>know</span>
that you have a secret and a plan in your head that I may
not know until summer.” Then Goldilocks smiled to
herself, as she remembered that she also had, or rather
was a part of, a secret of Miss Wilde’s that her mother
could not know until summer; and this secret had many
things in it,—girls and boys, needles and thread and bits
of coloured cloth, long walks into the far-away hemlock
woods, axes, and many other things!</p>

<hr class='tbk121'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>
It was now the last week in February. Every one was
on the lookout for the first spring migrants, and the children
were beginning to bring news of birds that they
had seen imperfectly and yet were sure were new arrivals
from the South. It was impossible that most of these
birds should have been in the vicinity, but the pictures
on the charts, mixed with equal portions of imagination
and hope, caused the children to <span class='it'>think</span> they saw the bird
that they wished to be the first to report, rather than the
one that was actually there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aside from the birds that are represented by a few
individuals all the year the only newcomers to hope for
are a few adventurous Blackbirds, the Purple Grackle,
and the Red-wing, and they are not usually seen in any
numbers before the beginning of March. There are three
birds, however, that, unless the month is very stormy, may
be expected at any time to show their fresh plumage and
bring the latest news of travel to their stay-at-home
brothers who have remained behind. These are the Bluebird,
the Song Sparrow, and the Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all know those. Even little brother Ebby knows
<span class='it'>those</span> birds,” said Clary, when Gray Lady proposed to
spend the morning in the company of the most homelike
and familiar birds of New England. “That is, Ebby
knows the Bluebird and Robin, and the Song Sparrow if
it is singing; but I do think Sparrows are dreadful hard to
tell by sight. If a Song Sparrow doesn’t sing, and turns
his back so’s I can’t see the big spot and the little one on
his breast, I don’t always know him myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope that we all know these three birds,” said Gray
Lady, “but, like old friends, we are even more glad to see
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>
them when they come than if they were the most brilliant
of strangers. Old friends also may bring news, and as for
birds, no one can ever be sure that there is nothing new
to learn of them. And as for what we do know, it becomes
fresh and new each spring with his return. One thing
about this bird is worthy of notice, and that is the wonderful
way in which Nature uses colour, both as an ornament
and a protection to her children. The majority of the
brightly coloured birds do not arrive until there are at
least a few leaves to screen them; the Oriole, Tanager,
Rose-breast, and Indigo-bird perching on leafless branches.
Yet the Bluebird and the Blue Jay, both of brilliant and
striking plumage, are with us when the trees are entirely
bare, and when evergreens are lacking they have only sky
or earth for a background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does this mean? Look out of the window,
Sarah, as you are the nearest to it, and perhaps you will
discover. <a id='bbird'></a>Do you see two Bluebirds in the branches of
the old Bell pear tree in the garden? No? Look again;
they are in the top, where the blue sky shows through the
smaller limbs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am; that is, I see something moving, but I
can’t see any colour. Oh, yes! now I do; it was because
the blue of their backs came right against the sky and
matched it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Gray Lady, “and the light underparts
match the snow and the ruddy breast the fresh earth, so
that the Bluebird’s beauty is his protection also; for as
our dear old friend John Burroughs says, ‘When Nature
made the Bluebird, she wished to gain for him the protection
of both earth and sky, so she gave him the colour
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>
of one on his back and the other on his breast; yes, and
we might also add a touch beneath of the snow that falls
from sky to earth.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the rest, who dares write of the Bluebird, thinking
to add a fresher tint to his plumage, a new tone to his melodious
voice, or a word of praise to his gentle life,
that is as much a part of our human heritage and
blended with our memories as any other attribute of home?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I, surely, for I know him too well, and each year
feel myself more spellbound and mute by memories he
awakens. Yet I would repeat his brief biography, lest
there be any who, being absorbed by living inward, have
not yet looked outward and upward to this poet of the
sky and the earth and the fulness and goodness thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the Bluebird was the first of all poets,—even
before man had blazed a trail in the wilderness or set up
the sign of his habitation and tamed his thoughts to wear
harness and travel to measure. And so he came to inherit
the earth before man, and this, our country, is all the
Bluebird’s country, for at some time of the year he roves
about it from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from
Mexico to Nova Scotia, though westward, after he
passes the range of the Rocky Mountains, he wears a different
dress and bears other longer names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In spite of the fact that our eastern Bluebird is a
home-body, loving his nesting-haunt and returning to it
year after year, he is an adventurous traveller. Ranging
all over the eastern United States at some time in the
season, this bird has its nesting-haunts at the very edge of
the Gulf States and upward, as far north as Manitoba and
Nova Scotia.</p>

“When the breeding season is over, the birds travel
sometimes in family groups and sometimes in large flocks,
moving southward little by little, according to season and
food supply, some journeying as far as Mexico, others
lingering through the middle and southern states. The
Bluebirds that live in our orchards in summer are very unlikely
to be those that we see in the same place in winter
days. Next to breeding impulse, the migrating instinct
seems to be the strongest factor in bird-life. When the
life of the home is over, Nature whispers, ‘To wing, up
and on!’ So a few of the Bluebirds who have nested in
Massachusetts may be those who linger in New Jersey,
while those whose breeding-haunts were in Nova Scotia
drift downward to fill their places in Massachusetts. But
the great mass of even those birds we call winter residents
go to the more southern parts of their range every winter;
those who do not being but a handful in comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before more than the first notes of the spring have
sounded in the distance, Bluebirds are to be seen by twos
and threes about the edge of old orchards along open roads,
where the skirting trees have crumbled or decaying knot-holes
have left tempting nooks for the tree-trunk birds,
with which the Bluebird may be classed. For, though
he takes kindly to a bird-box, or a convenient hole
in fence-post, telegraph pole, or outbuilding, a tree hole
must have been his first home, and consequently he has a
strong feeling in its favour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As with many other species of migrant birds, the male
is the first to arrive; and he does not seem to be particularly
interested in house-hunting until the arrival of the
female, when the courtship begins without delay, and
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
the delicate purling song, with the refrain, ‘Dear, dear,
think of it, think of it,’ and the low two-syllabled answer
of the female is heard in every orchard. The building of
the nest is not an important function,—merely the
gathering of a few wisps and straws, with some chance
feathers for lining. It seems to be shared by both parents,
as are the duties of hatching, and feeding the young. The
eggs vary in number, six being the maximum, and they
are not especially attractive, being of so pale a blue that
it is better to call them bluish white. Two broods are
usually raised each year, though three are said to be not
uncommon; for Bluebirds are active during a long season,
and, while the first nest is made before the middle of April,
last year a brood left the box over my rose arbour September
12, though I do not know whether this was a belated
or a prolonged family arrangement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As parents the Bluebirds are tireless, both in supplying
the nest with insect food and attending to its sanitation;
the wastage being taken away and dropped at a
distance from the nest at almost unbelievably short intervals,
proving the wonderful rapidity of digestion and the
immense amount of labour required to supply the mill
inside the little speckled throats with grist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young Bluebirds are spotted thickly on throat
and back, after the manner of the throat of their cousin,
the Robin; or rather, the back feathers are spotted, the
breast-feathers having dusky edges, giving a speckled
effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The study of the graduations of plumage of almost
any brightly coloured male bird, from its first clothing until
the perfectly matured feather of its breeding season, is
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>
in itself a science and a subject about which there are
many theories and differences of opinion by equally distinguished
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The food of the nestling Bluebird is insectivorous, or,
rather, to be more exact, I should say animal; but the
adult birds vary their diet at all seasons by eating berries
and small fruits. In autumn and early winter cedar and
honeysuckle berries, the grapelike cluster of fruit of
the poison ivy, bittersweet and cat-brier berries, are all
consumed according to their needs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Professor Beal, of the Department of Agriculture,
writes, after a prolonged study, that 76 per cent of the
Bluebird’s food ‘consists of insects and their allies, while
the other 24 per cent is made up of various vegetable substances,
found mostly in stomachs taken in winter.
Beetles constitute 28 per cent of the whole food, grasshoppers
22 per cent, caterpillars 11 per cent, and various
insects, including quite a number of spiders, comprise the
remainder of the insect diet. All these are more or less
harmful, except a few predaceous beetles, which amount
to 8 per cent, but in view of the large consumption of
grasshoppers and caterpillars, we can at least condone
this offence, if such it may be called. The destruction of
grasshoppers is very noticeable in the months of August
and September, when these insects form more than 60 per
cent of the diet.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not easy to tempt Bluebirds to an artificial feeding-place,
such as I keep supplied with food for Juncoes,
Chickadees, Woodpeckers, Nuthatches, Jays, etc.; yet it
has been done, and they have been coaxed to nest close
to houses and feed on window-sills like the Chickadees.
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
In winter they will eat dried currants, and make their
own selection from mill sweepings if scattered about the
trees of their haunts. For, above all things, the Bluebird,
though friendly, and seeking the borderland between
the wild and the tame, never becomes familiar, and never
does he lose the half-remote individuality that is one of
his great charms. Though he lives with us, and gives no
sign of pride of birth or race, he is not one of us, as the
Song Sparrow, Chippy, or even the easily alarmed Robin.
The poet’s mantle envelops him as the apple blossoms
throw a rosy mist about his doorway, and it is best so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We become attached to some birds for one reason,
and to others for totally different qualities. We admire
the Oriole and Tanager first through the eye,
because of their rich colouring. The Robin we
like because he is always with us, and he was probably
the very first bird that we knew by name and we could
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
watch from the moment the nest was built until the
young left it; so he awakens the general interest first,
and then the ear is won by his cheerful and sometimes
remarkable song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Catbird stirs one’s curiosity. We wonder what
he will say and do next; and when he throws back his
head to sing, we never can tell whether a dreamy melody
or a series of jeers will be the result. But the Song Sparrow
we love for himself alone, from the very beginning
of our acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In personal appearance he bears nearly all the markings
of his characteristic family, but the few exceptions,
if remembered, will tell you his name: his brown crown-feathers
have a gray parting-line, <span class='it'>his wings have no white
bars or yellow markings</span>, while the breast and sides are
streaked; one large spot in the centre, with sometimes a
smaller one close to it, tell the Song Sparrow’s identity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is seldom seen feeding on the ground like the
Chippy, but loves the shelter of low bushes, from which
he gives his warning cry of ‘Dick-Dick!’ and then flies
out with a jerking motion of the tail and, never going
high into the air, perches on another bush. If he wishes
to sing, he climbs from the dense lower branches to a
spray well above the others, as if he needed plenty of air
and light for the effort, and bubbles into song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As to the nest, well made of roots and bedded soft
with fine grass and hairs, the Song Sparrow uses his own
taste, as all birds do, and though the favourite place is
within the crown of a small bush not far above the ground,
or even in a grass tuft close to the earth itself, yet I have
found them in very different places.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
“Down in the garden a Song Sparrow once insisted on
building, not only in a flower-bed, but among the stalks
of perishable plants that would wither long before the
young left the nest. To prevent disaster, we drove
stakes on each side of the nest, fastened a fruit-box underneath,
and a shelter overhead, so that, when the overhanging
blossoms faded, the sun might not make broiled squabs
of the little ones. This brood was raised successfully, but
to our surprise the Sparrows began a second nest directly
opposite the first in the brush of the line of sweet-peas.
The location was chosen with more judgment, but in
picking the pea blossoms I passed within a foot of the
nest every morning during the whole time of building,
hatching, and feeding of the young.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This did not trouble the parents in the least; they
seemed to know that I would neither hurt them nor
intrude upon their privacy, by watching their movements
too closely, and the father of the family repaid me by such
music as I never before believed could come from the
throat of even a Song Sparrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At first I wondered why they should have chosen a
garden border, when there were so many near-by bushes
about the orchard edge, and tufted grasses and scrubs in
a waste meadow over the way. For, familiar as the Song
Sparrow is, and fearless, too, yet he is a reserved bird even
among his kin, not even travelling in great flocks, and does
not care, even when in the full spring ecstasy of song, to
be very near another singer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Presently I discovered the reason. Song Sparrows
love water, both for drinking and bathing: and, possibly
from close association with it, these bubblings of the little
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span>
wayside brooks have had an influence upon their song.
This particular year was a time of severe drought; the
near-by streams were dried up early in June, and the
‘birds’ bath,’ made of a hollowed-out log, and put in the
shelter of some vines at the far end of the garden, was
the nearest available water within half a mile. This trough
was filled every night, and as the hollow sloped gently at
one end, small birds could either walk in it to bathe, or
perch on the edge to drink; and it was the sight of the
first brood all bathing there, a few days after they left the
nest, that made me sure that it was this little watering
trough to which I owed their presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many other birds besides the Sparrows came as well,
and Robins and Wood Thrushes, who use wet clay in the
shaping of their nests, found it particularly useful. Now
I have a stone basin for the water, because the old wooden
one was decayed on our return, but I’m sure the birds
liked the mossy log the best, and Jacob Hughes is on the
lookout for another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady paused and looked up quickly, as though a
new idea had come to her; then, glancing at the older boys
who had that morning been working on a large Martin
house which had been ordered, and which made it certain
that the wayside drinking-fountain would be built as soon
as frost left the ground, she said, “This suggests something
more to be made for the spring sale. I saw some
fine oak and beech logs with the bark still on at the lumber
camp last week. If you are willing to undertake hollowing
them out, it will be a good investment for the Kind
Hearts’ Club to buy a half a dozen of them. When sawn
into lengths of three feet, and the ends covered with bark
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>
securely nailed, as all the bark covering must be, to prevent
splitting, the logs will be attractive both as drinking-troughs
for the birds and as features of the gardens where
they are placed, and I am sure that we shall have no difficulty
in selling them. Many people would establish drinking-places
for the birds if they had something suitable to
hold the water, but tin pans glisten, heat quickly, and
even earthenware dishes are slippery, while the hollow
log, that soon mosses over, must seem to the wild bird
like a natural bit of the woods. Only one thing must be
remembered: the log must not be allowed to become dry
at any season, or it will warp and split.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be worth the trouble of keeping such a fountain
filled, I am sure, if only to lure a single pair of Song
Sparrows about the garden or yard. For this Sparrow
is the only bird whose song I have heard in every month
of the year. Not the full spring song, of course, though I
have heard a very perfect melody in December; but in
dreary winter, when the scatter-brained <a id='rob2'></a>Robin has forgotten
his alarm cry of ‘Quick-Quick-Quick!’ the dear little
bird will find a warm spot in which to sun himself after
a hard-earned meal of gleaned weed seeds,—for like all
of his tribe he is a valiant Weed Warrior, working in the
home-fields when other birds have followed the sun for
richer fare,—and, after swelling his throat vainly for a few
moments, begin to whisper a song, as if in a dream, that
finally grows strong and clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, neither winter nor the darkness of night dishearten
the Song Sparrow. Last season, in the darkest
of summer nights, when some slight sound had awakened
the feathered sleepers, I have heard a few subdued bars of
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>
his song from almost under my window, and I have
thought, ‘Yes, there you are, dear little companion,
cheerful by day and night, in summer and in winter; how
much we, who are called the “higher animals,” have yet
to learn from you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another thing of interest about the Song Sparrow:
like the Bluebird, he belongs not alone to us of the East,
but to the whole United States as well. To be sure, he
changes his size, dress, and name slightly according to
location, as does the Bluebird; another proof of the
adaptability of the bird to circumstances.</p>

“Many birds that inhabit parts of the country having

in the cool, well-watered North, larger and of deeper hue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now is a chance for you to look at the map. The

Start at the extreme northern portion of Alaska. Here
is found the largest of the race, the Aleutian Song
Sparrow. Next come down to the coast of British Columbia
and Southern Alaska, where the rainfall is one hundred
and twenty-five inches in a year, and you see the

<p class='pindent'>“If you then travel farther to the desert regions of

and mind lies in the joy with which, like the bird wanderers,
we turn homeward at the end.</p>

the Cock Robin of story, is more nearly akin
in size and build to our Bluebird. If you want
to see the family marks that yoke the Robin

as they are leaving the nest, and you will see that instead
of wearing plain brick-coloured breasts like the parents,

didn’t find many berries, because the winter birds have
eaten them. Ma gave me some old cake to crumble
up, and I put some on the top of the stone fence, and
some right on the shed, and this morning when I first
looked out, a couple of them were out there eating it, and
I got a good square look at them. They liked that cake
because it had currants in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So Tommy is the first to report a ‘bran’-new’ Robin
flock,” said Gray Lady. “Now that they have really
come, will any of the others tell me what they know
about Robins? Begin at Sarah’s end of the table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robins build mud nests before there are any leaves
to hide them, and cats often get them when they are
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>
sitting,” said Sarah; “and then by and by, when they
build another nest, maybe they’ll put it out on a branch
that’s weak, and when it storms and the nest gets wet
and heavy, it falls down all of a lump. They seem to
get along best when they come under the porch or get
in a high up crotch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like Robins,” said Eliza, who sat next, “because
they stay around and let you look at them; but I think
that they aren’t very clever birds, for instead of keeping
quiet when anything comes near the nest, they holler
like everything, so that you can tell just where it is.
We had a nest in the grape-vine outside the kitchen
window, and you couldn’t believe what those little birds
ate in one day. I had the mumps and had to stay inside,
so I watched them. They ate all the time, that is, in
turn, for the old birds seemed to know just which one
had food last. Sometimes, if they had a little worm
or a bug, they gave it all to one, but if it was one of those
long, rubberneck earthworms, they would twist it and
bite pieces off and ram one down each throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Ma said it made her dreadful tired to see how
much those four little birds ate, and that if children were
as hungry as that, nobody would have the patience to
cook food and raise any. When they grew too big for
the nest, they sort of fell out into the vine and stayed
in that for a few days, and their father and mother fed
them just the same. They couldn’t fly well at first,
because their tails were so short that they upset.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You watched them quite carefully,” said Gray
Lady, “but can you tell me what happened after they
were able to fly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>
“Yes, ma’am, they acted real mean. They went right
down in the cedar trees beyond the garden to sleep, and
every morning before father or my brothers were up they
went into the strawberry bed, and even before any were
ripe, they bit the red side of the green ones and
spoiled them. Father was pretty mad, because our
land has run out for onions and we’ve got to raise berries
for a few years—all kinds, raspberries, currants, blackberries—to
even up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father dassent shoot the Robins, ’cause of the law,
and besides, we like ’em real well after berry time, so
brother John he made a plan, and it worked splendid.
He fixed up a nice little house like a chicken-coop and
put it on a stump in the middle of the bed, and then
he put our cat in the house. She was comfortable and
had good eating and plenty of air, but of course she
couldn’t get out, so she just sat there and growled and
switched her tail at the birds, and they stayed away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady laughed heartily at this scheme, which certainly
was very ingenious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was truly a new sort of scarecrow, and much
better than firing off blank cartridges in the nesting
season, when other birds might be frightened. However,
it proves one thing without a doubt, that cats are
the worst enemies that wild birds have to fear, and
shows us how careful we should be about turning
them out at large, outside of the cities where there are
no birds, or keeping more than one under any circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I meant to ask was, do you know what the
young Robins do after they leave the nest and the
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>
mother bird is perhaps busy with some younger brothers
and sisters?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The father birds choose some tall trees with plenty
of leaves, or if evergreens are at hand, they prefer them,
and go there in parties of from half a dozen to a hundred
every night, leaving the mother birds to tend the nest.
When the first brood is able to fly, they go with papa to
this roost, where his warning ‘Quick! Quick!’ tells them
of dangers they do not yet understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, when the nesting is over, all the Robins unite
in a flock, but wherever they go, or however far they range
in the day, night sees them collected at some favourite
roosting-place. I know about this habit very well,
because ever since I can remember these spruces outside
the window have been used as roosts by many
generations of Robins all through the season, except in
the dead of winter, when they prefer to nestle into the
heart of the young cedars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it is not to be denied that Robin likes berries
and eats them without asking leave or waiting for sugar
and cream, but we must think of this: the farmers
are of more importance than any other class of people,
for they give the world food. Therefore, the bird laws
are made for their benefit, even when at first it might
seem otherwise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Robin only troubles berries in June, July, and
August, and grapes in September, while all the rest of
the year he does valiant work as a gleaner of insects
that cannot easily be destroyed by man,—many beetles
that destroy foliage and their white grubs that eat the
roots of hay, grass, and strawberry plants, grasshoppers,
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>
crickets, ants, moths, army-worms, and the larvæ of the
owlet moths, better known as army-worms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you can see that if the Robin helps the farmers
in this way, the fruit grower should be willing to protect
his crops in other ways than by shooting his friend and
his children’s friend, the Robin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One other reason there is, also, why we of the North
should protect the Robin at home; in many southern
states he is a legal mark for all who wish to kill him.
Not only is the Robin to be found in the markets, but
shooting him merely for competition, to see who can
bag the most, is a common form of—sport, I was going
to say, but game of chance is better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the Kind Hearts of the North be kind to dear
blundering brother Robin, that by the very force of
example the hearts of others may be warmed to show
mercy and their heads be given the intelligence to see
that, in shooting the migrant Robins by the hundreds,
the loss is to their country and themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look! Oh, look, Gray Lady!” cried little Clary,
climbing to the window-seat; “here are some bright,
fresh Robins lighting on the spruces. Let’s play they
are some that roosted there last summer; or maybe were
hatched right in the orchard, and that they are real glad
to get home again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do the birds know when spring has come?
How can they tell the difference between a warm day
in December and a warm day in March when the ground
is still snow covered? We ourselves might be puzzled
to tell the difference if we had not kept record of the
days and weeks by the almanac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the birds know. The <a id='rwbird'></a>Red-wings, Grackles, and
<a id='cow1'></a>Cowbirds will not return for the warmest December
sun, but let the sun of early March but blink, and they
are up and away, oftentimes stealing a march on shy
Pussy-willow herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless the season is very stormy, as we have seen
for ourselves this year, a few Robins, Bluebirds, and
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span>
Blackbirds are added to the winter residents in February.
These, however, belong to a sort of roving advance-guard;
the real procession comes in March, the exact
time depending upon the weather, for the insect-eating
birds cannot stay if their larder of field and air is ice
locked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we may look for larger flocks of the birds that
drifted along in February, and in addition to these
the Woodcock, the Great Fox Sparrow as big as the
Hermit Thrush, Phœbe, Kingfisher, Mourning Dove, and
Field Sparrow of the flesh-pink bill, rusty head and back,
and buff breast, who sings his little strain, ‘cherwee-cher-wee-cherwee-iddle-iddle-iddle
ee,’ as the sun goes down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The three birds that are the most noticeable in the
latter part of March, that has made up its mind to go
out like a lamb and let Pussy-willow wave in peace in
moist pasture and the delicate blue-and-white hepaticas
star the edges of dry woods, are the Red-winged Blackbirds,
the Kingfishers, and the cheerful little Phœbe.
All love the vicinity of water, but the Red-wing locates often
in merely marshy ground, while the bird who is a fisherman
by trade locates near a pond or stream of considerable
size and the Phœbe comes to house or woodshed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Among all the birds that return to us in late March
or April, which is the most striking and most
compels attention?’ asked a bird-lover of a
group of kindred spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<a id='sparfox'></a>The Fox Sparrow,’ said one, who lived on the edge
of a village where sheltered wild fields stretched uphill
to the woodlands. ‘Every morning when I open my
window I can hear them almost without listening.’</p>

“ ‘<a id='phe2'></a>The Phœbe,’ said another, who was the owner of
a pretty home, where many rambling sheds broke the
way from cow-barn to pasture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The <a id='whip1'></a>Whip-poor-will, but that does not come until
late in the month,’ answered a third, a dweller in a remote
colony of artists in a picturesque spot of cleared woodland,
where the ground dropped quickly to a stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No, the Woodcock,’ said her nearest neighbour,
a man whose cottage was upon the upper edge of these
same woods, where they were margined by moist meadows
and soft bottom-lands,—a man who spent much time
out-of-doors at dawn and twilight studying sky effects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And I think it’s Red-winged Blackbirds,’ cried the
ten-year-old son of the latter; ‘for when I go out up
back of the trout brook by the little path along the
alders near the squashy place where the cat-tails grow
in summer, you’ve just got to hear them. You can’t
listen to them as you do to real singing-birds, for they
make too much noise, and when you listen for a bird it’s
got to be still, at least in the beginning. Sometimes
they go it all together down in the bushes out of sight,
then a few will walk out up to the dry Meadowlark’s
field with Cowbirds, or maybe it’s their wives, and then
one or two will lift up and shoot over the marsh back
again, calling out just like juicy sky-rockets. Ah,
they’re in it before the leaves come out to hide them
even the least bit.’ And, in spite of difference of viewpoint,
the group finally acknowledged that the boy was
right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In point of colouring, the Red-wing is faultlessly plumed,—glossy
black with epaulets of scarlet edged with gold,
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>
the uniform of a soldier,—and this, coupled with the
three martial notes that serve him as a song, would
make one expect to find in him all the manly and
military virtues. But aside from the superficial matter
of personal appearance, the Red-wing is lacking in many
of the qualities that endear the feathered tribe to us
and make us judge them, perhaps, too much by human
standards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When Red-wings live in colonies it is often difficult to
estimate the exact relationship existing between the
members, though it is apparent that the sober brown-striped
females outnumber the males; but in places
where the birds are uncommon and only one or two
male birds can be found, it is easily seen that the household
of the male consists of from three to five nests, each
presided over by a watchful female, and when danger
arises, this feathered Mormon shows equal anxiety for
each nest, and circles screaming about the general location.
In colony life the males ofttimes act in concert
as a general guard, being diverted oftentimes from the
main issue, it must be confessed, to indulge in duels and
pitched battles among themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Red-wing belongs to a notable family,—that of
the Blackbirds and Orioles,—and in spite of the structural
semblances that group them together, the differences
of plumage, voice, and breeding habits are very
great.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Cowbird<a id='cow2'></a>, the Red-wing’s next of kin, even lacks
the rich liquid call-note of the latter, and the lack of
marital fidelity, on the part of the male, is met in a truly
progressive spirit by the female, who, shirking all domestic
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span>
responsibility, drops her eggs craftily in the nests of
other and usually smaller birds, who cannot easily resent
the imposition; though a strong proof of the unconscious
affinity of race lies in the fact that these young
foundling Cowbirds invariably join the parent flocks in
autumn instead of continuing with their foster-mothers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='mead2'></a>The Meadowlark, with the true spring song, who hides
his nest in the dry grass of old fields, is also kin to the
Red-wing, and the Bobolink, too, the vocal harlequin
of the meadows and hillside pastures. The Orchard
and Baltimore Orioles, also next of kin, are skilled musicians
and model husbands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still another plane is to be found in the Red-wing’s
<a id='grack2'></a>dismal cousins, the Grackles,—Purple, <a id='grack3'></a>Rusty, Bronzed,
and Boat-tailed,—all harsh of voice and furtive in
action, as if a Crow fairy had been present at their creating
and, endowing them with ready wits, had, at the
same time, deprived them of all sense of humour and
cast a shadow upon their happiness. For a Grackle is
gloomy even during the absurd gyrations of his courtship,
and when, in autumn, the great flocks settle on
lawns and fields, and solemnly walk about, as they forage
they seem like a party of feathered mutes waiting to
attend the funeral of the year; and this trait somewhat
tinctures the disposition of the Red-wing before and
after the breeding season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Red-wing in one of his many subspecific forms,
and masquerading under many names,—Red-shouldered
Blackbird, American Starling, and Swamp Blackbird,—lives
in North America from Nova Scotia and the
Great Slave Lake southward to Costa Rica. The
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>
Red-wing, as known to us of middle and eastern
North America, breeds in all parts of its United
States and Canadian range, though it is more numerous
by far in the great prairies of the upper Mississippi Valley,
with their countless back-water sloughs, than anywhere
else. It is in regions of this sort that the great flocks
turn both to the fall-sown grain, as well as that of the
crop in the ear, causing the farmers the loss that puts
a black mark against the Red-wings. Yet those that
dwell east of this area, owing to the draining and ditching
of their swampy haunts being in much reduced
numbers, are comparatively harmless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“During the winter months the Red-wings are distributed
throughout the South, though stragglers may be occasionally
seen in many parts of their summer range.
Exactly why they begin the southward migration in
September and end it with the falling of the leaves
in late October, it is not easy to guess; for the food
supply is not at an end, and they do not dread
moderate cold, else why should they be in the front
rank of spring migrants?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The last of February will bring a few individuals of
the advance-guard of males. In early March their calls
are heard often before the ice has melted and the hylas
found voice; yet in spite of this hurried return, the
nesting season does not begin until the middle of May;
and so for two months and more the flock life continues,
and foraging, fighting, and general courting serve to kill
time until the remote marshes show enough green drapery
to hide the nests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a nest-builder the Red-wing shows much of the
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>
weaver’s skill of its Oriole cousins, though the material
they work with is of coarser texture, being fastened
firmly to low bushes or reeds and woven of grass
and the split leaves of reeds and flags, all nicely lined
with soft grasses and various vegetable fibres. Often,
like that of the Marsh Wren, the nest will be suspended
between three or four reeds, and so firmly
knit that it resembles one of the four-legged work-baskets
that belonged to the ‘mother’s room’ of
our youth. The pale blue eggs of the Red-wing are
particularly noticeable from the character of the markings
that thickly cover the larger end, for they seem
the work of a sharp scratching pen dipped in purplish
black ink and held by an aimless human hand, rather
than the distribution of natural pigment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An eater of grain though the Red-wing is, and a menace
to the farmer in certain regions, Professor Beal concedes
to him a liberal diet of weed seeds and animal food,
itself injurious to vegetation. Dr. B. H. Warren, who
has made a wide study of the food habits of this
Blackbird, says: ‘The Red-wing destroys large numbers
of cutworms. I have taken from the stomach
of a single Swamp Blackbird as many as twenty-eight
cutworms. In addition to the insects, etc., mentioned
above, these birds also, during their residence
with us, feed on earthworms, grasshoppers, crickets,
plant-lice, and various larvæ, so destructive at times
in field and garden. During the summer season fruits of
the blackberry, raspberry, wild strawberry, and wild cherry
are eaten to a more or less extent. The young, while under
parental care, are fed exclusively on an insect diet.’</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>
“Mr. Forbush also tells us that Kalm states in his
<span class='it'>Travels in America</span>, that in 1749, ‘after a great destruction
among the Crows and Blackbirds for a legal reward
of three pence per dozen, the northern states experienced
a complete loss of their grass and grain crops. The
colonists were obliged to import hay from England to
feed their cattle. The greatest losses from the ravages
of the Rocky Mountain Locust were coincident with,
or followed soon after, the destruction by the people of
countless thousands of Blackbirds, Prairie Chickens,
Quail, Upland Plover, Curlew, and other birds. This
coincidence seems significant, at least. A farmer from
Wisconsin informed me that, the Blackbirds in his
vicinity having been killed off, the white grubs increased
in number and destroyed the grass roots, so that he lost
four hundred dollars from this cause.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These facts should make us of the East welcome rather
than discourage the Red-wing; for this is one of the
species of familiar birds that must become extinct in
many localities, owing to the circumstance, so desirable
in itself, of reducing the waste marshlands, and though,
later in the year, other birds replace him acceptably,
March and April would seem lonely without the Red-wing,
for then, as the child said, ‘you’ve just got to
look at him.’</p>

“His plumage is beautiful in texture and soft in colour;
bluish gray that sometimes looks quite blue in the bright
light; wings and tail-feathers spotted with white, a white
collar deep in front and narrow at the back, and a broad
belt of the gray crossing the white breast and seeming
to keep the gray mantle from slipping from his shoulders.
The long head-feathers, also of the bluish gray, form a
crest that the bird can raise at will and thus put on an
expression of combined alertness and defiance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Kingfisher’s plumage is more perfect than his
form, his head, with its beak two inches in length, being
out of proportion to his short tail, and his small, weak
feet seeming too small to support a body more than
a foot long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In disposition the Kingfisher seems to be rather remote
and unfriendly; they never seem to travel in flocks,
and even in the nesting season, the only time in which
they associate in pairs, they seem to be quarrelling and
wrangling, so very harsh are their notes. Hereabouts
we have very few Kingfishers. Last summer a pair
tunnelled a hole in the loamy bank of the river fifty
feet below the grist-mill; for the Kingfisher does not
build a tree nest, or, in fact, any nest, but, like the
Bank Swallow, burrows sidewise into a bank of
sufficiently stiff soil not to cave in for the depth
of anywhere from three to fifteen feet. This burrow
may be only a few feet below the surface, or if the
bluff rises above the stream, the hole may be twenty
feet from the top and close to high-water mark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes the hole runs straight, and then again it
may have several turns before the nesting-chamber is
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>
reached, the turns probably being made to avoid stones
or tough roots; though one<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> careful observer, whose
account of this bird is so novel and charming (I will
read it to you from the scrap-book), thought for a time
that these turns might be for the purpose of keeping
light from the nesting-chamber.</p>

<hr class='tbk124'/>

<p class='pindent'>“A hole in a bank seems a strange place in which to
build a nest, but although one may know it to be the
home of a Kingfisher, he little imagines the singular
course of the passage leading to the room at the other
end, and is hardly aware of the six long weeks of faithful
care bestowed by the parent birds upon their eggs
and family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Early in April we may hear the Kingfisher’s voice,
sounding like a policeman’s rattle, as he patrols the
stream, and we often see him leaving a favourite limb,
where he has been keeping watch for some innocent
minnow in the water below. Off he goes in his slaty
blue coat, shaking his rattle and showing his top-heavy
crest, his abnormal bill, and pure white collar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mother bird, as usual with the sex, does most of
the work at home. The hole is generally located high
upon the bank, is somewhat less than four inches in
diameter, and varies from at least five to eight feet in
length. It slightly ascends to the dark, mysterious
den at the other end,—dark because the passage generally
bends once or twice, thereby entirely excluding
the light. The roof of the passage is vaulted from end
to end, merging into a domed ceiling almost as shapely
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span>
as that of the Pantheon. Such a home is built to stay,
and if undisturbed would endure for years. Two little
tracks are worn by the female’s feet the full length of
the tunnel as she passes in and out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Kingfisher’s knowledge of construction, her
ingenious manner of hiding her eggs from molestation,
and her constancy to her young arouse our interest
and admiration. We must also appreciate the difficulty
with which the digging is attended, the meeting of frequent
stones to block the work, which, by the way, may
be the cause of the change in direction of the hole, but
which I was inclined to believe intentional until I found
a perfectly straight passage, in which a brood was successfully
raised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To get photographs of a series of the eggs and young
was almost as difficult a task, I believe, as the Kingfisher
had in making the hole. It was necessary to walk
at least four miles and dig down to the back of the nest,
through the bank above, and fill it in again four times,
without deranging the nest or frightening away the parent
birds. But we were well repaid for the trouble, for the
pictures accurately record what could not be described.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A photograph of the seven eggs was taken before they
had even been touched, and numerous disgorgements of
fish bones and scales show about the roomy apartment.
The shapely domed ceiling, as well as the arch of the
passage, is constructionally necessary for the safety of
the occupants, the former being even more perfect than
the pictures show. What is generally called instinct in
birds has long since been to me a term used to explain
what in reality is intelligence.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>
“Some writer has mentioned that as soon as the
young Kingfishers are able, they wander about their
little homes until they are able to fly, but evidently his
experience was limited. My four pictures of the young
birds were taken by lifting them out of their nests and
placing them in a proper place to be photographed in
the light, but the first two pictures were taken in the
positions in which they were naturally found in the nest.
The first, when they were about two days old, was obtained
on the 21st of May, 1899, and the young were not
only found wrapped together in the nest, but the moment
they were put on the ground, one at a time, though their
eyes were still sealed, they immediately covered one
another with their wings and wide bills, making such
a tight ball that when any one shifted a leg, the whole
mass would move like a single bird. This is a most
sensible method of keeping warm, since the mother
bird’s legs are so short that she could not stand over
them, but, as they are protected from the wind and
weather, they have no need of her. Their appearance
is comical in the extreme, and all out of proportion.
This clinging to one another is apparently kept up for
at least ten days, for a week later, when nine days old,
they were found in exactly a similar position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the young were first observed, they were absolutely
naked, without the suggestion of a feather,
and, unlike most young birds, showed no plumage of
any kind until the regular final feathering, which was
the same as that of the adult, began to appear. The
growth of the birds was remarkably slow, and even
when nine days old the feathers were just beginning to
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
push through their tiny sheaths, but so distinctly showed
their markings that I was able to distinguish the sexes
by the colouring of the bands on the chest. They did
not open their mouths in the usual manner for food,
but tried to pick up small objects from the ground, and
one got another by his foot, as the picture shows. I
took two other photographs the same day, showing
several birds searching on the ground with their bills,
as if they were already used to this manner of feeding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the birds were sixteen days old, they had
begun to look like formidable Kingfishers, with more
shapely bills and crests, but as yet they evidently knew
no use for their wings. They showed little temper,
though they appeared to be somewhat surprised at
being disturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My next visit to the hole in the bank was when the
birds were twenty-three days old, and, to ascertain
whether they were still at home, I poked into the entrance
of the hole a long, thin twig, which was quickly accepted
by quite a strong bite. Taking the precaution to stop
the hole with a good-sized stone, I proceeded to my
digging for the last time on the top of the bank. This
time I found the chamber had been moved, and I had
some difficulty in locating it about a foot higher up and
about the same distance to one side. The old birds had
evidently discovered my imperfectly closed back door,
and either mistrusted its security, or else a heavy rain
had soaked down into the loosened earth and caused
them to make alterations. They had completely closed
up the old chamber and packed it tightly with earth
and disgorged fish bones.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span>
“The skill with which they met this emergency was
of unusual interest, showing again the ingenuity and
general intelligence which so often surprises us in the
study of birds. Their home was kept perfectly clean
by its constant caretaker. One of the full-grown birds,
with every feather, as far as I could see, entirely developed,
sat just long enough for me to photograph
him, and then flew from the branch where I had placed
him, down the stream, and out of sight, loudly chattering
like an old bird. One more bird performed the same
feat, but before I was able to get him on my plate. The
rest I left in the nest, and no doubt they were all in the
open air that warm, sunny day, before nightfall.</p>

<hr class='tbk125'/>

<p class='pindent'>“It happens that but few of us may look into a Kingfisher’s
home as Mr. Baily did, but it is very pleasant
to know where this dashing bird goes when, on securing
a fish, instead of swallowing it, he seems to dive, drop
into the water, and disappear, when in reality he is taking
his prey home to the nest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must be content to enjoy the Kingfisher as a
feature in the landscape, as the centre of a picture of
woods, pond, or river, to which he gives the needful
touch of life. The river scenery of March is lifeless and
dreary, for, if the snow has melted and the ice broken
up, the bushes alongshore are beaten down by the storms
of winter or partly submerged by the spring freshets.
Here and there, in sunny spots on the low shore, we may
see the purple-pointed hood and bright green leaves of
the skunk-cabbage, but if a Kingfisher is perching on
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>
a dead branch overhanging the water, crest erect, gazing
into the water and on the alert for a fish to pass, the
scene at once becomes full of interest. Of course the
Kingfisher, as his name implies, is above all a fisherman,
and complaints come sometimes from those who are
stocking ponds and rivers with fish, and who object to
his taking his tithe, but when pressed by hunger through
the sudden skimming of their hunting ponds with ice
in early winter, he has been known to eat berries of
many kinds, and in time of drought when streams run
low or dry up entirely, the Kingfisher will feed upon
beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, frogs, lizards, etc. But
here in the East, at any rate, the bird is not plentiful
enough to be a danger to the fishing industry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve seen a Kingfisher fishing in the salt-water creek
that goes into the bay. We camped right there on the
point last summer,” said Tommy. “He must have
lived up the river somewhere, for he used to come down
early in the morning, and stay about all day, and I suppose
he must have got through feeding his children, for
it was along in August. I never saw but one,—the male,
I guess, because it didn’t have any brown on its breast
like what there is in the picture of the female.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was great fun to watch him. One day the rest
all went off fishing to Middle Ground Light, and I stayed
at home because I’d cut my finger with a fish-hook, and it
hurt a lot, and the Doctor made me keep it soaking in
medicine, so I just lay in the sand under the shady side
of the tent, only moving enough to keep out of the sun,
and watched out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the Kingfisher first came, the tide was just
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span>
turned and beginning to rush out of the creek like everything.
Mr. Fisherman sat on a tall post that we tie the
boats up to at night. It was close to the water, not
where the strong current was, but a little to one side,
where it was more still. He did pretty well for a while;
the fish looked small, and he swallowed ’em without
wriggling his throat so very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing he did was very funny; he didn’t dive
right down from the post after the fish, but he took a
little fly up first and then folded his wings to his sides
and dropped right in beak first, same as we fellows do
when we jump off the spring board dad rigged to a raft
and then dive. I couldn’t make out whether he always
did it, or if it was because the post was too near the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After a little, the water went down so that the post
wasn’t near enough to the water; then what did he do
but shift over to the bowsprit of an old oyster boat that
was wrecked and half buried in the sand, right in the
bank just inside the creek; this gave him a fine perch
right over the channel. When he saw that there was
no one about, he sort of settled down, and looking
at him so long made me lazy, and I guess I fell asleep
and didn’t see him dive, because the next thing I
knew, there was the Kingfisher back on the perch, but
he had an eel in his beak instead of a fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Gray Lady, did you ever try to hold an eel in
your fingers, without rubbing wet sand on them first?
Well, you should have seen that bird twist and flop about.
It was only a little eel, not any bigger than a pencil, but,
oh my!” And Tommy laughed heartily at the very memory
of the fray.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>
“Kingfisher couldn’t stick to the perch, so he dropped
right on to a piece of the deck of the boat that wasn’t
buried, and began to beat the eel on the wood and dance
about. The eel squirmed so, it didn’t hit often, and it
acted as if it had legs and was dancing too. When
the fun began, the bird had the eel about in the middle,
but it pulled away until one end was longer than the
other, and that made it harder to hold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which was the head end, the one that hung down?”
asked Eliza, who always insisted on precise details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know then,” said Tommy; “I couldn’t see,
and it didn’t keep still long enough for me to ask!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last Kingfisher gave the eel a good bang, and it
didn’t squirm so much (then I knew the head must have
been on the long piece because it wouldn’t have hurt
its tail), and the bird began to swallow and work his
throat, just like when a snake begins to work a toad
down. Once or twice he stopped, and I thought that he
was going to choke and keel over. He didn’t, though,
but after it was all down, he looked real sorry and uncomfortable
and his feathers laid down almost flat to
his head, and he crouched there on the boat quite a while
before he flew up creek and didn’t fish any more that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he’d never caught a salt-water eel before, and
didn’t know how lively they are; you can’t measure them
by mud eels out of still water any more’n you can match
snakes with ground-worms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='phe3'></a>The very name of Phœbe calls us from the Red-wing in
the marsh meadows and the Kingfisher by the
waterways and brings us home again. Not only
within the home acres, but close to the house, barns, and
woodshed, for has she not been living in and about them
quite as long as we have, or even longer? There was
a Phœbe who always built her first nest on the deep
sill of the dormer-window of the store-closet, and her
second in the bracket that supports the hood of the
north window in the guest-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was not very tidy about her work of nest-building
(it seems more natural to call the Phœbe <span class='it'>she</span> than <span class='it'>he</span>), but
then, it must be very difficult to make a nest with a high
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span>
foundation of crumbling moss and mud, with hairs and grass
for a lining, without spilling some of the nesting material.
My mother used to grumble about having the store-room
window-sill remain in such a litter for so long, but she
never disturbed the nest, even by brushing away the
loose moss, and almost every day she would look through
the window to see how the eggs or young were faring, and
I thought it a great privilege to be allowed to go to the
store-room and sit quite still inside the closed window
and watch the Phœbe’s housekeeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was in this way that I first learned how the bird
stands up in the nest and turns the white eggs over with its
feet so that they may be evenly warmed through; how the
young are fed and the droppings removed from the nest
so that it need not become foul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In spite of great care and constant bathing, for
Phœbe is very fond of a bath and was always a great
patron of the log water-trough, the puddles that gathered
in the gutter after rain, and upon occasion would dash into
the bucket that always stood under the well-spout, the
poor bird suffers greatly from insect parasites. The
reason for this I cannot tell, unless it is that the foundation
of the nest is so light and spongy on account of the moss,
that the air does not pass through and the lice breed
freely. One thing I remember, however, is that as
soon as the birds had flown, mother always removed the
empty nest and had its resting-place thoroughly cleansed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is not so apt to happen when the bird chooses a
fresh location and makes a new nest for a second brood,
but upon the only occasion that the window-sill nest was
used twice in a season, the lice crawled through the window-frame
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>
into the house, and of the second brood, only
one lived to fly, and he was a miserable, emaciated little
thing, so badly did the lice beset the young birds. After
that, mother always gave them a hint that a new nest was
best by making it impossible for them to use the old one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think the Phœbes might have got mad and
gone away for good,” said Sarah Barnes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; they either understood that mother’s intentions
were good, or else they appreciated the comfort and
cleanliness of the new nest, for their children and grandchildren
have occupied the two sites ever since, and this
summer when I stood inside the store-room window showing
the nest to Goldilocks, bird and nest were just the
same as when my mother stood there by me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is why the everyday birds that live about our
homes are so precious and should be so carefully guarded.
We never see them grow old, and so they help us to keep
young in heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phœbe belongs to a very important family, that of
the Flycatchers, songless birds with call-notes that are
distinctive; these take their food upon the wing, diving
from a perch into the air for it as the Kingfisher dives
into the water for his. In this way the flycatchers are
among the most valuable of the Sky Sweepers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Among Phœbe’s cousins you will find the <span class='it'>Kingbird</span>,
who wears a slate-coloured coat and white vest, a crest on
his head, and a white band on the end of his tail by which
you may know him, as he sits on a fence rail, stump,
or even on a tall mullen stalk and sallies out into the
air, crying a shrill ‘Kyrie-Kyrie!’ The Great Crested
Flycatcher, with an olive-brown coat, gray throat, and yellow
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span>
belly, who builds in a tree hole well above the ground,
and uses dried snake skins among his materials when he
can get them, is another relative, and the largest of the
family; while a third is the little Wood-pewee, of the dark
olive-brown coat and two whitish wing-bars, who saddles
his lichen-covered nest, as dainty as that of a Humming-bird
high up on a limb, and calls his plaintive note, Pee-wee-pee-a-wee
peer,’ through the aisles of the deep woods,
as constantly as Phœbe lets her name be known in a more
shrill and rasping voice to the barnyard flock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These and several other flycatchers do not come to us
until May, but the Phœbe of all his tribes trusts his livelihood
to the care of gusty March. Perhaps it is the early
return that makes the Phœbe so friendly and causes
it to choose either a site by the water or near a house.
Insect life awakes much more quickly in gardens and about
the farm-yards, or near open running water, than in the
remote woods; for certain it is that no other member of
the family is so easily domesticated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Phœbe not only eats the earliest insects that
appear, but it has peculiarly constructed eyes, like the
Whip-poor-will and Night Hawk; it can catch its food until
the end of twilight, so that it kills many bugs that hide all
day. Among the hurtful insects that it catches are the
click-beetle, brown-tail moth, canker-worm moth, and the
elm beetle. As a berry-eater no one can find fault with it,
as when late in a dry season it takes a little fruit, wild
berries supply the need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All this should be a hint to us to leave a few nooks
about the place for a pair of Phœbes to appropriate for
a homestead; a little shelf under suitable shelter is all
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>
they ask, or, better yet, nail a few wide braces under the
roof of a wagon, cattle, or wood shed, even if it does not
need supporting. Then, before the first Robin or Chipping-sparrow
awakens, when the first flush of light penetrates
the darkness of night, you will have a home sentinel
at hand to cry, ‘Phœbe! I see, all’s well!’ to the morning,
and at evening she will blend her voice with the Whip-poor-will’s
in wishing you good night, for though Phœbe
is early to come in the spring and early to rise in the morning,
she goes late to bed and meets the bats in the sky
during her evening excursions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe Phœbes don’t really sing, but they think they
do,” said Tommy, as Gray Lady looked in vain in her
scrap-book for a poem that should do the bird justice
and be catching in rhythm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes in May they get up on the roof or the telephone
wire or something like that, and tumble somersaults
into the air and cry ‘phœbe-phœbe-phœbe-phœbe,’
on and on and on and over again, like the Katydids and
Katydidn’ts in the maples at night, only the Phœbe is so
worked up she can only think of her own name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then this verse of Lowell’s at least is true,” said Gray
Lady, closing the scrap-book.</p>

“When the Chickadee, who has persistently told us his
name all winter, and has assured us also in the darkest
weather that it was ‘day-day-day,’ changes his call for
the flute-like spring song of ‘Phewe-Phe-wee,’ clear as the
wind blowing through a reed, we know that at last the
springtide has really turned. Chickadee occasionally
gives this note in autumn as if in anticipation, but it is
really a love-song of tender accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='goose'></a>Another spring sign comes to us in April, a sign to be
seen. It comes out of a clear sky and has all the mystery
about it that still shrouds the bird migrations. Spring and
fall I see it, but it always fills me with awe. This morning
I stood out in the open meadow below the orchard, looking
at the sky to see if the clouds were going to break away,
or if it was to be a day of April showers. To the southwest
a curious fine black bar appeared high up against the
clouds. Quickly it drew nearer, and I saw what seemed
to be a great letter that moved rapidly and yet kept
its shape printed on the sky,—a letter V coming toward me,
point on. In another minute the line proved to be made
of separate marks, then each mark developed a long neck
and rapidly moving wings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy Todd could stand it no longer; without giving
the usual school “hand up” warning he cried out, “The
V was Wild Geese, with the wise old gander that leads
them for the point, and maybe if he wanted them to shift
and change their way, he gave a big honk, honk, like the
automobiles when they turn the sharp corner at the foot
of our hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We saw Wild Geese yesterday, grandpa and I; they
were flying so low over the mill-pond that grandpa said
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>
maybe they had been resting somewhere. They do stop
in fall sometimes, but in spring they generally go right over
in a big hurry. This time I could see their feathers pretty
well, black, gray, and light underneath, and a white mark
around the neck as if it was tied up for a sore throat.
Grandpa says he shot one once that was a yard long, but
their necks looked all of that. How far away do they
have to go before they can stop to nest, please, Gray
Lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They nest only in our most northern states, and from
there up through British America; but as the country is
settled they have to shift their haunts very often, for
you can well imagine that a colony, even in the nesting
season, would have but little peace if hunters could reach
it easily. These great birds on their journeys are one of
the most thrilling sights that everyday people can see,
for they travel the thousands of miles that separate their
summer and winter homes, straight through the night as
well as the day, without chart or compass, but with the
same lack of fear and unfailing directness as a train would
follow the rails upon the road-bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We hear and read stories of Nature that are inventions,
and could not have happened because they are not according
to the plan of creation,—so the people who tell these
instead of being clever are really very stupid,—but not
one of these is as wonderful as the simple truth, or
as awe-inspiring as the flight of Wild Geese that goes
on before our sight year after year in the April sky,
or that we know by their cries and the rush of wings
is passing overhead in the gloom of a wild and stormy
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though a few of our common birds, like the Robin,
Bluebird, Woodcock, Crow, Grackle, and some of the
Hawks and Owls, begin to nest in April, May and June are
the real nesting months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the spring migration is over, we call those birds
who have decided to stay with us and build their homes
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>
Summer Residents, and it is from these that we must learn
of the home life of birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The visitors who stop awhile on their way to other
places we may learn to call by name, but we can never
really know them any more than we can a chance visitor
who boards a few weeks in our vicinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The nesting habits of birds and the manner in which
they build their homes vary according to the necessity and
skill of the species. (See <span class='it'>Citizen Bird</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In their house-building you will find that the birds
know almost as many trades as human beings, for among
them are weavers, basket-makers, masons, and carpenters,
as well as workers in felt, hair, and feathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many water-birds merely make a hollow in the sand or
gather a few bits of grass together for a nest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Grouse, Quail, and Woodcock scratch up a few
leaves in a ground hollow or between stumps, for, like
domestic fowl, they always nest on the ground and their
colour, being dull, blends with it, and you may almost
step on one of these birds when it is on its nest and never
know it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dull brown Sparrows build nests of grasses set in
a low bush or between its roots, but the flaming Oriole
weaves himself a snug hammock high out on a swaying elm
bough, and the Scarlet Tanager builds high in an oak.
The Blue Jay weaves small roots into a firm nest set well
above reach, while the Bluebird lines a hollow in a tree
or takes an abandoned Woodpecker’s hole for his house.
The Woodpeckers chisel out homes in tree-trunks, and
Robins and Cliff and Barn Swallows use more or less mud,
and plaster the inside of their homes. If you watch carefully
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span>
now when the birds are building, and associate the
various nests with the birds that build them, in autumn,
when the young have flown, you can collect many of these
nests and study their beautiful workmanship. But pray
keep your hands off them while they are in use, for it is
not being either kind or polite to meddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you think your mother would feel if somebody
climbed in at the window and tumbled up your
baby brother’s crib, perhaps spilling him out on the floor,
or at least frightening him badly, in order to find out if he
slept on a mattress or a feather bed, or if the crib itself
was made of wood or metal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the time of the spring migration the birds that
have been living in flocks all winter put on fresh feathers,
and court and separate into pairs just as people do when
they marry and begin housekeeping. Naturally they feel
very happy, and have a great deal to say to each other,
and this is what makes birds break into song when the
spring comes to give them new life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though some few females can sing, it is the males who
make the beautiful music that we hear in the spring
mornings. The female is too busy with her housekeeping
to do more than answer, but her husband’s song cheers
her while she is brooding, and he probably tells her how
pretty her new feathers are, and how much he loves her, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Among our gayly coloured birds, unlike people, it is
the male who wears the brightest clothes. You have
heard of this all through our fall and winter lessons, and
you have seen the difference in pictures; now that the
birds themselves have come, you will have a chance to
see how well you remember, and if you can name the birds
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>
as they fly. The Scarlet Tanager and the Goldfinch both
have plain greenish olive-coloured wives. The female
Blue Jay is of a less bright hue than her mate, and the
mate of the Rose-breasted Grosbeak wears a buff, brownish
streaked vest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Because, as the mother bird spends more time
about the nest than the father, if she wore bright clothes
she would attract too much attention, and cruel Hawks,
squirrels, and thieving people would find it too easily;
and Nature’s first thought is always of the care and protection
of young life, whether of plant, bird, or beast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost all of our birds feed the young nestlings with
animal food, even if they themselves are seed-eaters;
for little birds must grow quickly, and you would hardly
believe the number of worms and flying things it takes to
turn one little Robin from the queer, helpless, featherless
thing that it is when it hatches from the egg, into the
clumsy, clamouring ball of feathers, with awkward wings
and hardly a bit of tail to balance it, that it is when it
leaves the nest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No human father and mother work harder to feed their
children than do these feathered parents, who toil ceaselessly
from sunrise until sunset to bring food, and share
by turns the protection of the nest.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>WINGED MYSTERIES</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Four birds there are that live under one roof, so to
speak, for they belong to one order divided into three different
families. They are perfectly familiar to most of us who
have lived in the real country, and yet they awaken our
curiosity anew every season when they return. These
birds are the Whip-poor-will, <a id='swift3'></a>Chimney Swift, <a id='nhawk2'></a>Nighthawk,
and <a id='hum1'></a>Humming-bird. The two first return to New England
late in April; the two last during the first part of May,
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>
but it is better for us to take them all together now in
April so as to be ready to recognize the first one that
comes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>Whip-poor-will</span> comes first. It is a bird of the
woods; in size a little less than the Robin, but of a
build peculiar to its own family, long and low, a contrast
heightened by its short legs and its habit of sitting length-wise
on a limb and close to it. In short, it does not
perch, it ‘squats.’ Its general colour is black, white, and
buff, much streaked and mottled. Its tail is <span class='it'>round</span>, half
of the three outer feathers white, giving the effect of a
white spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of you children of this wooded hill country know
this bird that flies about the house and across the fields
to the woods before dawn or soon after dark, making no
more noise than the bats, until, stopping to rest, he mechanically
jerks out his name, ‘Whip-poor-will-Whip-poor-will-Chuck!’
So lonely and mournful does the cry sound
in the distance that many weird stories have been told
about the bird. But when the call comes close at hand,
it is more cheerful, though always startling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This bird builds no nest, but lays its pair of dull white
eggs, so marked that they blend with the earth like
lichens and mosses, on the bare ground, or at best among
a few leaves. But rash as this seems, the protective
colour that nature has given to the parents, eggs, and
young serves to keep them as safe as many another bird
in a well-woven tree nest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, too, aside from its picturesque qualities, the
Whip-poor-will, as Mr. Forbush says of it, ‘is an animated
insect trap. Its enormous mouth is surrounded by long
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span>
bristles which form a wide fringe about a yawning cavity,
and the bird flies rather low among the trees and over the
undergrowth, snapping up nocturnal insects in flight.
It is, perhaps, the greatest enemy of night-moths, but is
quite as destructive to May beetles and other leaf-eating
beetles.’</p>

“<a id='nhawk3'></a><span class='it'>The Nighthawk</span>, when perching, bears a general resemblance
to the Whip-poor-will. The white band on its
throat is wider, the tail is <span class='it'>not</span> round, and it has
white band near the end. There is a white
bar across the quills of the wings that in flight looks like
a round white spot or a hole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These four white patches, throat, wings, and tail tell
you his name plainly, so when he is on the wing the Nighthawk
should never be mistaken for a Whip-poor-will.
Then, too, their habits are unlike. The Nighthawk does
not belong to the night, neither is he a Hawk, which is
a Bird of Prey with talons and a hooked beak. Early
morning and late afternoon are his favourite times for
hunting the sky for insects, for he also is one of our most
valuable sky sweepers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having no song, the cry of Skirk-skirk! given when
on the wing, has a wild and eerie sound which is often
followed by a booming noise of the quality that can be
imitated by placing tissue-paper over a long, coarse comb
and then blowing rapidly across it from one end to the
other. This noise is made by the rush of the wind through
<span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>
the wing quills as the bird drops through the air after its
winged food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Nighthawk builds no nest, but lays its eggs on a
bare rock in a field, amid the stones of rocky ground, on
roofs even of city houses. Again does colour protection
aid a bird, for the arrangements of its markings blend
the Nighthawk with granite as perfectly as those of the
Whip-poor-will conceal it in the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Nighthawk, whose erratic flight makes it a target
that piques the skill of a certain class of sportsmen, has
frequently been shot at for prowess, the excuse being that
it ‘wasn’t any good, anyway.’ Aside from the list of insects
harmful to agriculture and domestic animals that
it destroys, let us remember its crowning virtue, and cry
‘Hands off!’ It kills mosquitoes, and has thus earned
the local name of Mosquito-hawk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is hard to believe that any one should insist that
the Nighthawk and the Whip-poor-will are one and the
same bird, but such has been the case, and among intelligent
people also, though the mistake has been definitely
settled by one of the Wise Men.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A NIGHTHAWK INCIDENT</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A discussion of the specific distinctness of the Whip-poor-will
and Nighthawk, following an address to Connecticut
agriculturists some years ago, led to my receipt,
in July, 1900, of an invitation from a gentleman who was
present, to come and see a bird then nesting on his farm
that he believed combined the characters of both the
Whip-poor-will and Nighthawk; in short, was the bird to
which both these names applied.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i437.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0043' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>NIGHTHAWKS</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span>
Here was an opportunity to secure a much-desired
photograph, and armed with the needed apparatus, as
well as specimens of both the Nighthawk and Whip-poor-will,
I boarded an early train for Stevenson, Connecticut,
prepared to gain my point with bird as well as with man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The latter accepted the specimens as incontrovertible
facts, and readjusted his views as to the status of the birds
they represented, and we may therefore at once turn our
attention to the Nighthawk, who was waiting so patiently
on a bit of granite out in the hayfields. The sun was
setting when we reached the flat rock on which her eggs
had been laid and young hatched, and where she had last
been seen; but a fragment of egg-shell was the only evidence
that the bare-looking spot had once been a bird’s
home. The grass had lately been mowed, and there was
no immediately surrounding cover in which the bird
might have hidden. It is eloquent testimony of the value
of her protective colouring, therefore, that we should almost
have stepped on the bird, who had moved to a near-by
flat rock as we approached the place in which we had
expected to find her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far more convincing, however, was her faith in her own
invisibility. Even the presence of a dog did not tempt her
to flight, and when the camera was erected on its tripod
within three feet of her body, squatting so closely to its
rocky background, her only movement was occasioned by
her rapid breathing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was other cause, however, besides the belief in her
own inconspicuousness to hold her to the rock: one little
downy chick nestled at her side, and with instinctive
obedience was as motionless as its parent.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span>
So they sat while picture after picture was made from
various points of view, and still no movement, until the
parent was lightly touched, when, starting quickly, she
spread her long wings and sailed out over the fields.
Perhaps she was startled, and deserted her young on the
impulse of sudden fear. But in a few seconds she recovered
herself, and circling, returned and spread herself
out on the grass at my feet. Then followed the evolutions
common to so many birds but wonderful in all. With
surprising skill in mimicry, the bird fluttered painfully
along, ever just beyond my reach, until it had led me a
hundred feet or more from its young, and then, the feat
evidently successful, it sailed away again, to perch first
on a fence and later on a limb in characteristic (length-wise)
Nighthawk attitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How are we to account for the development in so many
birds of what is now a common habit? Ducks, Snipe,
Grouse, Doves, some ground-nesting Sparrows and Warblers,
and many other species also feign lameness, with
the object of drawing a supposed enemy from the vicinity
of their nest or young. Are we to believe that each individual
who in this most reasonable manner opposes strategy
to force, does so intelligently? Or are we to believe that
the habit has been acquired through the agency of natural
selection, and is now purely instinctive? Probably
neither question can be answered until we know beyond
question whether this mimetic or deceptive power is
inherited.—<span class='sc'>Frank M. Chapman</span>, in <span class='it'>Bird-Lore</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='swift4'></a>Now comes the <span class='it'>Chimney Swift</span>, universally called the
Chimney Swallow; with small, compact body, only a little
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>
larger than a Bank Swallow, and long, strong wings, it
dominates the air in which it lives and feeds, and so
little does it use its feet that it does not perch
on them, but brackets itself against post, wall,
or chimney, Woodpecker fashion, the sharp, pointed quills
of its short tail acting as a brace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In colour the Chimney Swift is sooty gray, and as it
darts about the sky it looks like a winged spruce cone, the
wings being held further forward in flight than those of
the average bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like their cousins the Nighthawks, they feed chiefly
in early morning and late afternoon, though in the nesting
season this work continues all day. In the old wild days,
like many another bird, this Swift built its basket nest of
twigs and bird glue on the inside wall of hollow trees,
but when man came, hollow trees went, and so, with the
happy adaptability of Heart of Nature himself, the bird
moved to the hollow chimneys of man’s own invention,
and so, unwittingly, descended from his sky parlour and
became the one real fireside bird that we have. And
for this companionship he is willing to brave the risk of
being smoked out and having sparks scorch his nest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that wide-mouthed stone chimneys are also disappearing,
what remains for this Swift? We do not
know, unless he changes his home to the open air and
builds his bracket nests on outside walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Swift folds his wings and dives down the chimney
to his nest silently as a bird cleaves the water, but when he
rises, a roar of rapidly whirring wings marks the ascent,
so that sometimes it annoys the people in whose rooms
the chimney opens. Last summer, in the old orchard-house
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>
where Miss Wilde lives, we used to sit before the
wide fireplace and listen to the Swifts twittering and
whirling in and out of the chimney, and by looking up on
a bright day their nests could be seen plainly. Once in
a while an accident would happen, and Goldilocks will
show you a beautiful bracket nest and five white eggs that
became loosened after a storm and fell out on to the
hearth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But now that there is a fire all the time and a coal
stove at Swallow Chimney, won’t the birds choke if they
live there?” asked Sarah Barnes. “Grandma says they
can stand wood smoke, but that coal-gas ‘spixiates’ ’em;
’cause we’ve never had any at our house since we’ve been
burning coal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe that your grandmother is right,” said Gray
Lady, “and for this reason I have planned to have a new
outside chimney for the cooking stove, so that the real
‘Swallow Chimney’ may be only used for the wood
hearth fires, and so continue to be their home for as long
as I live or the birds wish to rent it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The last and least of the four-winged mysteries is
also the smallest of our birds, lacking a quarter of being
four inches long. But it does not need size to proclaim
its beauty any more than a glowing ruby or emerald;
and indeed it wears both of these gems, the one on its
throat and the other on its back. Its world is the garden
where everything is brightest, its food nectar, and such
little aphis as gather in it, and its home lashed by cobwebs
to a slender branch, a fairy nest of plant, wool, and lichens,
soft as feather down, wherein lie two eggs, white and
opaque and glistening like some fresh-water pearls.</p>

workmanship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In spite of the fact that Father Humming-bird takes
himself to parts unknown and leaves his mate to tend both
eggs and birds, the mother is neither put out nor discouraged,

swallows the food for her tiny offspring and then, by a
pumping process called regurgitation, brings it up and, taking
no chances of spilling a drop, literally rams it into
the little throat! This bird is to me the greatest mystery
of all. It comes and it goes, but how does it endure the
stress of weather and travel? Many a moth outspans it
in breadth of wings. If the flight of the Wild Goose is

“I know it,” answered little Clary; “I know his colour
and the way his song tinkles, but up at our house we call
him Song Thrush. Why, Gray Lady, he doesn’t
live in the woods; we haven’t any woods. He
stays right around the garden and orchard, and last
summer they made a nest in the crotch of a sugar-maple
so low that I could see into it by standing on the fence.
It looked just like Robin’s nest, and it had some rags

water, or the falling of raindrops in the summer woods.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Thrush has a sharp alarm note, ‘Pit! Pit!’ and
a sort of whistle that he seems to use as a signal. Fruit
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>
he does eat at times, but he has as long a list of evil
insects to his credit as the Robin himself. Unfortunately,
owing to his size and plumpness, southern vandals shoot
him in the fall and winter. Fancy silencing his heavenly
voice for a pitiful mouthful of meat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is another Thrush that lives in your river woods,
Dave, smaller than the Wood Thrushes, tawny of back,
and a buffy breast with faint arrow-shaped spots upon it,
the Wilson’s Thrush, or Veery. It has not so long and
varied a song as either the Wood Thrush or the more
northern Hermit Thrush, is really but an echo song,
wonderfully pure and spiritual in quality. One of the
Wise Men gives in syllables this ‘Ta-weel-ah-ta-weel-ah,’
pronounced in whispering head tones, and then repeated
a third lower, ending with the twang of a stringed instrument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At evening and until quite late into the night these
birds echo themselves and each other. It is not a song
to hear amid laughter and talking, but for the heart that
is alone, even if not lonely. To at least one of our poets,
he who best interprets the song-life of birds, it rivals the
famous English Nightingale.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='veery2'></a>“Aside from its musical value, the Veery, feeding as it
does almost altogether on insects, has a practical side as
a neighbour. It also has a most penetrating call-note, a
‘Whew! Whew!’ heard after the song is over, that is at
once resentful, critical, and challenging, as if questioning
your right to be in its woodland retreat in the nesting
time, and condemning your persistence. Many people,
who do not know the bird by sight, know both its echo
song and its note of alarm and challenge.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><a id='thrash2'></a>THE BROWN THRASHER</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Also called <span class='it'>Brown Thrush</span>, <span class='it'>Red Mavis</span>, <span class='it'>Planting Bird</span>.
Brown of back, with his white throat and belly speckled
with black arrow marks, a long, curved bill, and long, restless
tail, whose thrashing gives the bird his name, this
bird combines the markings of the Thrush with the general
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span>
build of a true Mockingbird, while in varied and rich
song it rivals the <a id='cat3'></a>Catbird, its shorter song season, however,
leaving its gray-backed neighbour in the lead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This spring Brown Thrasher came to the bushy end
of the orchard the last of April, and scratched about in
the leaves like a Grouse. In a few days I saw him in
the back of the garden, where Jacob had a great pile of
pea-brush. This the bird looked at favourably. Birds
know how to get in and out of pea-brush, but cats are
afraid of the sharp twigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a couple of weeks or more I heard him singing
every day in the tree-tops, and I wondered where he would
locate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jacob, one morning, told me that he wished to use the
pea-brush, but that a ‘pair of great brown birds that beat
their tails and “sassed” him when he came near’ had built
a nest of twigs in the back of the heap. ‘My friends, the
Thrashers,’ said I, ‘will need that brush for a couple of
months. Have you no more in the lot?’ Jacob had
plenty with only the trouble of carting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now hardy vines have grown over the brush and
tangled into what Goldilocks calls a lovely ‘Thrashery’
that will last for several years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know them,” said Jack Todd; “they are mockers
and jeerers for certain; when Dad and I plant the big
south field with corn every spring, they come in the berry-bushes
by the fence and tell us how to do it, and that if
we’re smart and take their advice, we won’t cut the fence
brush until they are done with nesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But can’t they pick cherries to beat the band? Last
summer I was up in the ox-heart tree and they came in
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span>
the top and picked ’em off, just as they grew in pairs, and
flew away with them as pleased and satisfied as if they
were picking them for market and were a week ahead of
the season. Dad was awfully down on them once, but
one morning about two years ago he got up at daylight
to try and get the cutworms that were spoiling his early
cauliflowers, and there were Thrashers and Catbirds doing
the work for him, watching out for the worms to move
ground just as clever as a man could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As<a id='cat4'></a> for the <span class='it'>Catbird</span> or <span class='it'>New England Mockingbird</span>, trim
of shape, and shrewd of eye, what should we do without
him? He is a graphophone in feathers, that
gives us selections from all the popular bird songs of
the day, with this addition—there is no mechanical
twang to mar the melody, and when the repertoire is
ended he improvises by the hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, the merry, mischievous Mocker, all dressed in a
parson’s suit of gray, with a solemn black cap on his head
that is as full of tricks as his throat is of music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say, ‘Yes, I know that he is a jolly musician, but
my father says that he bites the best strawberries and
cherries, and always on the ripest cheek!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, so he does <span class='it'>sometimes</span>; but his ancestors lived
on that spot where your garden stands before yours did,
and you have more ways of earning a living than he has.
Give him something else to eat. Plant a little wild fruit
along your fences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people think that he likes to live in seclusion,
but he doesn’t; he likes to be near people and perch on a
clothes-pole to plume and sing. Yes, indeed, and he
shall nest in the syringa nearest my garden, where he gets
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>
his fresh fruit for breakfast, and be the only thing with
anything catlike about it on my premises!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span><h1>XXV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BIRD AND ARBOUR DAY AT FOXES CORNERS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first Friday of May, the day that was set
apart for Arbour and Bird Day in the schools. Gray Lady
and Miss Wilde had thought of having the celebration in
Birdland, but for a good reason decided to hold it in the
schoolhouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reason was this: One day after the schoolhouse
had been put in order,—for Gray Lady had persuaded
the town fathers to have the walls painted, and had then
given a band of soft green burlap that covered the wall
just above the chair board, and made a fine background
against which pictures might be pinned and then changed
at will,—little Clary said with a sigh, “I wish we could
have a bird party here in school some day, so’s mother
could <span class='it'>see</span> how we learn about the birds; it would be much
realer than my telling her about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So a very simple programme was arranged for the forenoon,
and the parents invited. It is a great mistake to
hold celebrations that are too long when it is spring, and
the weather is so bright and the bird music so fine that
people can learn much more by being out-of-doors than in
poring over books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first part of the programme was under the charge
of Jacob Hughes and the older boys. It consisted in the
planting of some strong young sugar-maples to complete
the row between the schoolhouse and the highway that
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>
had been begun last autumn. The holes had been dug
the day previous, and Mr. Todd brought the trees from
his grove in the hay-cart, with plenty of earth about their
roots, and after they were set straight and true, the boys
filled in the holes and tramped the earth down firmly.
After this the little boys brought water, four pails being
considered a sufficient drink for each tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next, a dozen shrubs were planted in the eastern corner
of the bit of ground where it rolled up toward the brush-lot
and the earth was deep and good. They were varieties
that would flower in May and June, before the closing of
school. Syringa, Weigela, Yellow Forsythia, Purple and
White Lilac, Snowballs, Spireas, Scarlet Flowering Quince,
Strawberry Shrub, and Deutzia. Between this shrubbery
a little strip along the north fence had been made into a
long bed of about thirty feet, and the girls had been asked
to collect enough hardy plants from about the farm gardens
to fill it; for there is little use in planting bedding or
annual flowers in school yards, for these are later in starting
and are killed by early frost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls had been very successful in their task, and a
goodly assortment of old-fashioned, hardy plants, that
many a gardener would envy, was the result: Iris of
several shades, Peonies, Sweet Williams, Larkspur, Foxgloves,
Honesty, May Pinks, Lemon Lilies, Johnny-jumpers,
and several good roots of Cinnamon and Damask
Roses were among the collection, while Sarah Barnes’
grandmother sent a basket of the roots of hardy button
Chrysanthemums—pink, white, crimson, yellow, and
tawny—that she said would hold out from October to
Thanksgiving if they had “bushes between them and the
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span>
north.” It was quite eleven o’clock when, the planting
over and the benches that the boys had made during
the winter set in place, the children, whose hands were
washed under very difficult conditions, gathered in the
school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But those parents who cared to come had meanwhile had
a chance to go into the little building, see the pictures,
charts, and books on the shelf behind the desk, and chat
with Miss Wilde in a friendly, informal way that was
helpful to all concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goldilocks had been there all the morning, but when
Gray Lady arrived she brought with her a friend of “the
General’s,” who was also a <span class='it'>Wise Man</span> in one of the chief
agricultural colleges of the country, who had promised
to talk to the children. Gray Lady herself was to read
them some bird poetry, and Miss Wilde a little story of
her own invention, while as a finale the children themselves
were to recite some verses where ten familiar birds
were represented each by a child who wore a cap and
shoulder cape, cleverly made of crêpe paper, that would
give a clew, at least, to the bird he or she represented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These costumes had been made at the last Saturday
meeting of the Kind Hearts’ Club, in the playroom at
“the General’s,” and had caused no little fun, the idea of
them having come from the caps in the mottoes at that
orchard party, in September, eight months before, when
the children first entered Birdland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the poem that Gray Lady read. She had a voice
that sang even in speaking, and as Goldilocks often said,
“When mother reads bird poetry you don’t hear the words,
but the birds themselves.”</p>

“I do declare!” exclaimed Tommy Todd’s grandfather,
speaking out loud, much to the boy’s embarrassment.
“I reckon I’ll get out a pole and go a-trout-fishing to-morrow
dawn. I haven’t thought of a yallerthroat, not since
I used to go casting in the brook that ran through Ogden’s
meadows among the bush willows, and them birds kept
hollerin’ on ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is what the Wise Man told the children, standing
in front of Miss Wilde’s desk and speaking as if he knew
them all by name.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE BIRDS AND I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The springtime belongs to the birds and me. We own
it. We know when the May-flowers and the buttercups
bloom. We know when the first frogs peep. We watch
the awakening of the woods. We are wet by the warm
April showers. We go where we will, and we are companions.
Every tree and brook and blade of grass is ours;
and our hearts are full of song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are boys who kill the birds, and girls who want to
catch them and put them in cages; and there are others
who steal their eggs. The birds are not partners with
them; they are only servants. Birds, like people, sing
for their friends, not for their masters. I am sure that
one cannot think much of the springtime and the flowers
if his heart is always set upon killing or catching something.
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>
We are happy when we are free; and so are the
birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The birds and I get acquainted all over again every
spring. They have seen strange lands in the winter, and
all the brooks and woods have been covered with snow.
So we run and romp together, and find all the nooks and
crannies which we had half forgotten since October. The
birds remember the old places. The Wrens pull the sticks
from the old hollow rail and seem to be wild with joy to
see the place again. They must be the same Wrens that
were here last year and the year before, for strangers
could not make so much fuss over an old rail. The Bluebirds
and Wrens look into every crack and corner for a
place in which to build, and the Robins and Chipping-sparrows
explore every tree in the old orchard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the birds want to live with us, we should encourage
them. The first thing to do is to let them alone. Let
them be as free from danger and fear as you or I. Take
the hammer off the old gun, give pussy so much to eat
that she will not care to hunt for birds, and keep away the
boys who steal eggs and who carry sling-shots and throw
stones. Plant trees and bushes about the borders of the
place, and let some of them, at least, grow into tangles;
then, even in the back yard, the wary Catbird may make
its home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some kinds of birds we can build houses. You
have been doing this all through the winter, I hear.
Some of the many forms which can be used are shown in
the pictures, but any ingenious boy can suggest a dozen
other patterns. Although birds may not appreciate
architecture, it is well to make the houses neat and tasty
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span>
by taking pains to have the proportions right. The floor
space in each compartment should be not less than five
by six inches, and six by six or six by eight may be better.
By cutting the boards in multiples of these numbers, one
can easily make a house with several compartments; for
there are some birds, as Martins, Tree Swallows, and
Pigeons that like to live in families or colonies. The size of
the doorway is important. It should be just large enough
to admit the bird. A larger opening not only looks bad,
but it exposes the inhabitants to dangers of cats and other
enemies. Birds which build in houses, aside from Doves
and Pigeons, are Bluebirds, Wrens, Tree Swallows, Martins,
and sometimes the Chickadee. For the Wren and Chickadee
the opening should be an inch-and-a-half augur-hole,
and for the others it should be two inches. Only one
opening should be provided for each house or compartment.
A perch or doorstep should be provided just below
each door. It is here that the birds often stop to arrange
their toilets; and when the mistress is busy with domestic
affairs indoors, the male bird often sits outside and entertains
her with the latest neighbourhood gossip. These
houses should be placed on poles or on buildings in somewhat
secluded places. Martins and Tree Swallows like to
build their nests twenty-five feet or more above the
ground, but the other birds usually prefer an elevation less
than twelve feet. Newly made houses, and particularly
newly painted ones, do not often attract the birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if the birds and I are companions, I must know them
more intimately. Merely building houses for them is not
enough. I want to know live and happy birds, not dead
ones. We are not to know them, then, by catching them,
<span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span>
nor stuffing them, nor collecting their eggs. Persons who
make a business of studying birds may shoot birds now
and then, and collect their eggs. But these persons are
scientists and they are grown-up people. They are trying
to add to the sum of human knowledge, but we want to
know birds just because we want to. But even scientists
do not take specimens recklessly. They do not rob
nests. They do not kill brooding birds. They do not
make collections merely for the sake of making them;
and even their collections are less valuable than a knowledge
of the bird as it lives and flies and sings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boys and girls should not make collections of eggs, for
these collections are mere curiosities, as collections of
spools and marbles are. They may afford some entertainment,
to be sure, but one can find amusement in
harmless ways. Some people think that making collections
makes one a naturalist, but it does not. The
naturalist cares more for things as they really are in their
own homes than for museum specimens. One does not
love the birds when he steals their eggs and breaks up
their homes; and he is depriving the farmer of one of his
best friends, for birds keep insects in check!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stuffed birds do not sing and empty eggs do not hatch.
Then let us go to the fields and watch the birds. Sit down
on the soft grass and try to make out what the Robin is
doing on yonder fence or why the Wren is bursting with
song in the thicket. An opera-glass or spy-glass will
bring them close to you. Try to find out not only what
the colours and shapes and sizes are, but what their habits
are. What does the bird eat? How much does it eat?
Where is its nest? How many eggs does it lay? What
<span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span>
colour are they? How long does the mother bird sit?
Does the father bird care for her when she is sitting?
For how long do the young birds remain in the nest?
Who feeds them? What are they fed? Is there more
than one brood in the season? Where do the birds go
after breeding? Do they change their plumage? Are
the mother birds and father birds unlike in size or colour?
How many kinds of birds do you know?</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are some of the things which every boy or girl
wants to know; and we can find out by watching the
birds! There is no harm in visiting the nests, if one does
it in the right way. I have visited hundreds of them
and have kept many records of the number of eggs and
the dates when they were laid, how long before they
hatched, and when the birds flew away; and the birds
took no offence at my inquisitiveness. These are some
of the cautions to be observed: Watch only those nests
which can be seen without climbing, for if you have to
climb the tree, the birds will resent it. Make the visit
when the birds are absent if possible; at least, never
scare the bird from the nest. Do not touch the eggs or
the nest. Make your visit very short. Make up your
mind just what you want to see, then look in quickly
and pass on. Do not go too often, once or twice a day
will be sufficient. Do not take the other children with
you, for you are then apt to stay too long and to offend
the birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now let us see how intimately you can become acquainted
with some bird this summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span>
This is the little story that Miss Wilde read them, and
they were very anxious as to what schoolhouse and
children she really meant, but she said that was a secret.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE BIRDS AND THE TREES</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was May Day. Half a dozen birds had collected in
an old apple tree, which stood in a pasture close by the
road that passed the schoolhouse; some of them had not
met for many months, consequently a wave of conversation
rippled through the branches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were in a great hurry, the last time I saw you,”
said the little black-and-white Downy Woodpecker to
the Brown Thrasher, who was pluming his long tail, exclaiming
now and then because the feathers would not
lie straight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! When? I do not remember. What was I
doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the last of October; a cold storm was blowing
up, and you were starting on your southern trip in such
a haste that you did not hear me call ‘good-by’ from
this same tree, where I was picking insect eggs that
expected to hide safely in the bark all winter, only to
hatch into all kinds of mischief in the spring. But I was
too quick for them; my keen eyes spied them and my beak
chiselled them out. Winter and summer I’m always at
work, yet some house-people do not understand that I work
for my living. They seem to think that a bird who does
not sing is good for nothing but a target for them to
shoot at.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is true,” said the dust-coloured Phœbe, dashing
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span>
out to swallow a May beetle, which stuck in her throat,
causing her to choke and cough. “I can only call, yet I
worked with the best for the farmer where I lodged last
year. I made a nest on his cowshed rafters and laid two
sets of lovely white eggs, but his boys stole them and that
was all my thanks for a season’s toil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Singing birds do not fare much better,” said the
Thrasher. “I may say frankly that I have a fine voice
and I can sing as many tunes as any wild bird, but children
rob my nest, when they can find it, and house-people
drive me from their gardens, thinking I’m stealing berries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They treat me even worse,” said the Robin, bolting
a cutworm he had brought from a piece of ploughed land.
“In spring, when I lead the Bird Chorus night and morning,
they rob my nest. In summer they drive me from
the gardens, where I work peacefully, and in autumn,
when I linger through the gloomy days, long after your
travelling brothers have disappeared, they shoot me for
pot-pie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a shame!” blustered Jennie Wren. “Not that
I suffer much myself, for I’m not good to eat, and I’m a
most ticklish mark to shoot at. Though I lose some eggs,
I usually give a piece of my mind to any one who disturbs
me, and immediately go and lay another nest full.
Yet I say it is a shame, the way we poor birds are treated,
more like tramps than citizens, though we are citizens,
every one of us who pays rent and works for the family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear, hear!” croaked the Cuckoo, with the yellow
bill. He is always hoarse, probably because he eats so
many caterpillars that his throat is rough with their hairs.
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span>
“Something ought to be done, but can Jennie Wren tell
us what it shall be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve noticed that most of the boys and girls who rob
our nests and whose parents drive us from their gardens
go every day to that square house down the road yonder,”
said Mrs. Wren. “Now if some bird with a fine voice
that would <span class='it'>make</span> them listen could only fly in the window
and sing a song, telling them how useful even the songless
bird brothers are, they might treat us better and tell their
parents about us when they go home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well spoken,” said the Robin; “but who would venture
into that house with all those boys? There is one
boy in there who, last year, killed my mate with a stone
in a bean-shooter, and also shot my cousin, a Bluebird.
Then the boy’s sister cut off the wings of these dead
brothers and wore them in her hat. I think it would be
dangerous to go in that schoolhouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The windows are open,” said the Song Sparrow, who
had listened in silence. “I hear the children singing, so
they must be happy. I will go down and speak to them,
for though I have no grand voice, they all know me and
perhaps they will understand my homely wayside song.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the Sparrow flew down the road, but as he paused
in the lilac hedge before going in the window, he heard
that the voices were singing about birds, telling of their
music, beauty, and good deeds. While he hesitated in
great wonder at the sounds, the children trooped out, the
girls carrying pots of geraniums which they began to
plant in some beds by the walk. Then two boys brought
a fine young maple tree to set in the place of an old tree
that had died. A woman with a bright, pleasant face
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span>
came to the door to watch the children at their planting,
saying to the boys, “This is Arbour Day, the day of planting
trees, but pray remember that it is Bird Day also.
You may dig a deep hole for your tree and water it well;
but if you wish it to grow and flourish, beg the birds to
help you. The old tree died because insects gnawed it,
for you were rough and cruel, driving all the birds away
from hereabouts and robbing their nests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, ma’am,” said a little girl, “our orchard was full
of spinning caterpillars last season and we had no apples.
Then father read in a book the government sent him
that Cuckoos would eat the caterpillars all up, so he let
the Cuckoos stay, and this year the trees are nice and
clean and all set full of buds!”</p>

<hr class='tbk131'/>

<p class='pindent'>The Song Sparrow did not wait to hear any more, but
flew back to his companions with the news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall put my nest under the lilac hedge to show the
children that I trust them,” said he, after the birds had
recovered from their surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will lodge in the bushes near the old apple tree,” said
the Cuckoo; “it needs me sadly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will build over the schoolhouse door,” said the
Phoebe; “there is a peafield near by that will need me
to keep the weevils away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I will take the nice little nook under the
gable,” said Jennie Wren, “though I need not build for
two weeks yet, and I have not even chosen my mate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall go to the sill of that upper window where the
blind is half closed,” said the Robin. “They have planted
<span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>
early cauliflowers in the great field and I must help the
farmer catch the cutworms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will stay by also,” said the Woodpecker. “I know
of a charming hole in an old telegraph pole and I can see
to the bark of all the trees that shade the schoolhouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then a gust of wind blew through the branches,
reminding the birds that they must go to work, and May
passed by whispering with Heart of Nature, her companion,
about the work that must be done before June
should come,—June, with her gown all embroidered with
roses and a circle of young birds fluttering about her
head for a hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Master,” May said, “why am I always hurried
and always working? I do more than all other months.
July basks in the sun and August sits with her hands
folded while the people gather in her crops. Each year
March quarrels with Winter and does no work; then April
cries her eyes out over her task, leaving it dim and colourless.
Even the willow wears only pale yellow wands
until I touch them. The leaf buds only half unfold, and
the birds hold aloof from the undraped trees; see, nothing
thrives without me.” And May shook the branches
of a cherry tree and it was powdered with white blossoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing grows by or for itself,” said Heart of Nature,
tenderly. “The tree is for bird and the bird for the tree,
while both working together are for the house-people if
they will only understand me and use them wisely.
Never complain of work, sweet daughter May. Be thankful
that you have the quickening touch, for to work in
my garden is to be happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Song Sparrow caught up the words and wove
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span>
them in his song and carolled it in May’s ear as she swept
up the hillside to set the red-bells chiming for a holiday.</p>

<hr class='tbk132'/>

<p class='pindent'>These are the verses that the children recited. Goldilocks
asked the question in the first line of each verse, and
the child who represented the bird answered. Little
Clary was the first,—the Chippy,—and as she said the
words she raised her arms and flapped them like wings;
the parents all applauded with delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some cloudy morning early in the month, you will
hear a new call. At first it may suggest the coo-oo-oo of
the Mourning Dove, then the drumming of the Flicker,
but after waiting for a moment you realize that it is
<span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span>
neither. <a id='cuck2'></a>The first sound is like that made by clicking
the tongue rapidly against the roof of the mouth; the
second sounds like cow-cow-cow-cow-cow repeated in
quick succession. By this you will know that the <span class='it'>Yellow-billed
Cuckoo</span> has come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be disappointed when first you see the bird
itself, for it does not in the least resemble the bird of the
English poets, who lives in Cuckoo clocks and
bobs out to tell the hours. Neither is it a lazy
bird who refuses to build a nest and leaves its
eggs to the care of others like the Cowbird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Yellow-billed Cuckoo is a slender bird cloaked
in brownish gray, of a soft hue and with a light belly.
The tail-feathers are tipped with white, so that, as you look
at the bird from below, it shows large white spots. This
Cuckoo takes its name because the lower part of its bill
is yellow, but you will scarcely notice this when he is in
the trees, where he spends the greater part of his time in
searching for insects and caterpillars, which are his favourite
food.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>YELLOW-BILLED CUCKOO</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The nest is a shallow, rather shiftless sort of an affair,
and very often has so little lining that if the vine or bush
in which it is placed tips a little, the pale blue eggs are
in danger of rolling out. What the Cuckoos lack in housekeeping
thrift they make up as destroyers of harmful
insects, and here it has helped to keep the old orchard
alive by tearing apart the nests of the tent-caterpillar
and eating the inhabitants. These mischievous caterpillars
used to be content to live in the wild cherry trees that line
the roads and old pastures. People cut these down in
consequence, so after a time the caterpillar found that
<span class='pageno' title='405' id='Page_405'></span>
apple trees were quite as much to his taste and seized
upon the orchards. Then comes Master Cuckoo, and
wherever the tent worms are, there we find him also. So
many has he been known to devour that one of the Wise
Men, upon examining the stomach of a Cuckoo that had
been killed, found it lined with a sort of felt made from
the hairs of the caterpillars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, if you hear the harsh call near by, be very glad;
the sound may not please the ear, but the bird is a pleasure
to the sight as he slips away silently through the trees
to do work for us that we cannot do as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='vireored2'></a>“The <span class='it'>Red-eyed Vireo</span>, excepting the Catbird, is the most
talkative bird that we have; in fact, so fond is he of the
sound of his own voice that he is rarely silent
during the daylight hours. Then, too, his eloquence
has a questioning and arguing quality that made
Wilson Flagg give him the nickname of ‘The Preacher,’
by which he will always be known. ‘You see it—you
know it—do you hear me? Do you believe it?’ he
hears this voice say, and if you keep these words in your
mind, you will recognize the bird the first time that you
hear his song. You may hear the Vireo’s words twenty
times for every peep that you may get of his person; not
that he is at all shy, but he is restlessness in feathers,
while unlike many talkers he both talks and works at
the same time. Now he is at the end of a branch close
to you, then on the opposite side of the tree, from whence
he works his way to the very top, clearing the small
limbs and twigs of insects as he goes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After trying in vain to see him, one day when you
are not thinking of this or any other bird, you will pass
<span class='pageno' title='406' id='Page_406'></span>
a familiar tree, one of the apples, perhaps, whose branches
nearly sweep the ground. Your eye in going idly over
the leaves halts at an object that is partly suspended
between the forked twigs of a branch almost under your
eye. You look again; it is a nest, pocket-shaped, and
fastened between the twigs as the heel of a stocking is held
between knitting needles. The nest itself is finely woven of
plant-down, soft bark, and perhaps a few shreds of paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You step nearer; a little head with a long, curved beak
rises slightly above the nest,—Madam is at home. An
eye holds your own,—a red eye with a long, clear, white
mark over it by way of an eyebrow. Then you notice
the head wears a gray cap bordered with black. The
bird perhaps breathes a little faster, and the prettily
shaded olive-green back heaves and the wings twitch as
if to make ready to fly, otherwise the bird does not budge,
but simply sits and waits for you to go; this, if you are
really one of the Kind Hearts, you will do very soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, you may come back the next day and the next,
and from a comfortable distance watch the Vireo’s housekeeping
and the progress of her brood, only please do not
touch either the nest or its contents. After she has done
with it and autumn comes, you may have it for your own
and see for yourself how wonderfully it is made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All sorts of amusing bits of printing from newspapers
have been found woven into these nests, and there is one
in Goldilocks’ cabinet, that I will show you later, that
says upon the shred of paper,—‘an eight-room flat,—electric
light and —— —— improvements,’ the
missing words being concealed where the paper was
woven under the plant fibres.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THREE LISPERS AND A VENTRILOQUIST</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“When the trees are putting on their best and greenest
leaves, many new sounds mingle with the hum of insects
among the branches. You pause and look up
in the confusing mass of fluttering green and
sunbeams to find, if possible, the origin of these sounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many feathered shapes are fluttering about, some
flying after the manner of birds, while others flit and move
in the irregular fashion of butterflies, while the notes they
utter, instead of being full-throated, have a sort of childish
lisp.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='408' id='Page_408'></span>
“<a id='reds3'></a>These birds belong to the tribe of <span class='it'>Warblers</span>; a few do
really warble, but for the majority the <span class='it'>Lispers</span> would be
a more appropriate title. Listen! there comes a little
call now, as if the bird had kept his beak half closed,
‘Sweet-sweetie-sweazy!’ and a bird of light build and no
larger than a Chippy flits backward from the twig where
he was perching and alights on one below, following in
his flight one of the insects of which he is a valiant destroyer,
as he belongs really to both the order of Tree
Trappers and Sky Sweepers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now is your chance; he is at rest for a moment; look
at him,—black of back, head, and breast, some salmon-red
feathers on wings and tail, and the sides of breast
rich, pure salmon, and the belly white. What a brave
little uniform, almost the Oriole colours. One of the Wise
Men who has met the Redstart in his winter home in
Cuba says that there he is called ‘<span class='it'>Candelita</span>, the little
torch that flashes in the gloomy depth of tropical forests.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing secluded about him, however, except
the depths of shade where he feeds and weaves his nest, in
texture much like the Vireo’s. His mate is also a very
dainty bird, but his flame colour and black is replaced
by pale yellow and gray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Redstart is a bird to know in May and June,
though it does not leave until early in October.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><a id='ybird'></a><span class='it'>The Summer Yellowbird</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“From the apple trees or shrubs near the house
comes a cheerful lisping song that constantly declares
that life up among the leaves is ‘Sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweeter,’
ending this remark by a warble full of melody.
<span class='pageno' title='409' id='Page_409'></span>
Then a little bird smaller than a Chippy flits out with a
bit of green worm hanging from his beak and disappears in
another tree. Brief as the glimpse is, you see that the
bird is rich olive-yellow, with cinnamon streaks on the
breast. If he pauses a moment, you will notice that
the underparts are almost the colour of gold. This is the
<span class='it'>Yellow Warbler</span> of many names,—<span class='it'>Wild Canary</span>, <span class='it'>Summer
Yellowbird</span>, or simply <span class='it'>Yellowbird</span>; though this name
is also commonly given to the seed-eating Goldfinch of
the Sparrow tribe who wears a jaunty black cap, and
stays with us all the year, while the Yellow Warbler goes
southward before leaf-fall in September.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Yellow Warbler’s nest is one of the most beautiful
and interesting bird-homes, and shares the fame of that
of the Baltimore Oriole, Wood Pewee, Humming-bird, and
Vireo. It is cup-shaped and deep, woven of fibres and
plant-down, and is placed in the fork of a bush or in a fruit
tree, where it is as firmly lashed by cords of vegetable
fibre and cobwebs. The female is the builder and a very
rapid workwoman. This nest is often used by the Cowbird,
but little Mrs. Yellow Warbler is more clever than
many other small birds and refuses to be imposed upon.
She is evidently afraid to push out the alien egg, so she
swiftly walls it in by building a second nest on top of the
first. If this does not check the Cowbird, a third nest is
sometimes added, like the one that Tommy brought me
last fall, and there is a two-story nest in Goldilocks’
cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Warbler is not only beautiful to look at and
pleasant to hear, but he is a very valuable tree trapper,
for he eats the spinning cankerworms and also tent-caterpillars,
<span class='pageno' title='410' id='Page_410'></span>
pulling apart webs of the latter and using them
‘for cordage’ to bind the nest. He is also a destroyer of
plant-lice and something of a flycatcher as well.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><a id='throat2'></a><span class='it'>Maryland Yellowthroat</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is a merry bird that you cannot miss seeing or
fail to name if you have eyes and ears. Olive on head and
back, this bird certainly has a yellow throat, also much
yellow on tail, wings, and underparts, but if I had the
naming of it I should call him the ‘Yellow, Black-masked
Warbler,’ for he wears a narrow mask of black across his
face, through which his keen eyes peer provokingly as he
flits ahead calling for you to follow, ‘Follow me—follow
me—follow!’ When you see the bird, of two points
you may be sure at once; it is yellow, and it wears a black
mask, but whether it is yellowest on back, throat, or
breast will require a second look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This bird is here about the garden and lane from May
to September, and last June we found its long, bulky nest,
partly covered like an Indian cradle, in the bushes between
the garden and orchard, but it usually is so clever at going
into the bushes and then darting along close to the ground
to its nest, that we had known of this nest for several
days before we discovered that it belonged to Black Mask,
for his wife, who kept the nearest to the nest, wears no
mask, and we thought her some other kind of Warbler.</p>

“A whistle comes out of the bushes that line the wood
lane perhaps when you are gathering the pink Wild Azalea.
If you have a dog with you, he will get up and sniff about.
The whistle is repeated, and you yourself think it is one
of your companions who has rounded the turn calling
you. No; then it is merely a Catbird mocking half a
dozen other songsters and then jeering at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='chat2'></a>“By mere chance, glancing at a tree close above, you
see a bird of good size with brilliant yellow throat, breast,
and wing-linings, and a strong curved beak that appears
almost hooked. Perching there is a Yellow-breasted
Chat. He it is who is doing the mocking and jeering,
but throws his voice in such a way that it seems to
come from the opposite bushes. It is this power that
gives him the name of ‘Ventriloquist.’ Being observed,
he slips quickly out of sight, and then you notice the
olive-green colour on his back. He has a song of his own
as well as the power of imitating others and in the nesting
season floats out upon the air, with spread wings and legs
<span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Singers in Costume</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Among the birds many of the best vocalists are choir
singers, as it were. We hear their voices first, and from
hearing them desire to know and name the singers. The
Thrushes belong to the first group. Others there are who
come on the stage in brilliant costume; we see them first,
then desire to hear them sing, and afterward remember
them as pleasing both to eye and ear. These are the
gentlemen of the Opera, and four of them made the garden
and orchard their music-hall last summer and I do not
doubt will do so again. In fact the Goldfinches have
never left, but a flock in sober winter suits have fed at
the lunch-counter on the sunflower heads and fluttered over
the weed seeds in the fields all winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Baltimore Oriole should be first mentioned, for
his voice is that of the bugler that heralds actual spring,
the long-expected, long-delayed mellow period, distinct
from the almanac spring, that, when it once comes to us
of the middle and north country, is quickly absorbed by
the ardour of summer herself. Also is this Oriole the gloriously
illuminated initial letter wrought in ruddy gold
and black pigments heading the chapter that records the
season; and when we see him high in a tree against a
light tracery of fresh foliage, we know in very truth that
not only is winter over, that the treacherous snow-squalls
of April are past, but that May is working day and night
to complete the task allotted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For as the Indian waited for the blooming of the dogwood,
<span class='it'>Cornus florida</span>, before planting his maize, so does the
prudent gardener wait for the first call of the Oriole before
she trusts her cellar-wintered geraniums and lemon balms
once more to the care of Mother Earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='414' id='Page_414'></span>
“This Oriole has history blended with his name; for it is
said that George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore, tired
and discouraged by many of the troubles of his Newfoundland
colony, in visiting the Virginia settlement in 1628,
explored the waters of the Chesapeake, where he found
the shores and woods alive with birds, and conspicuous
among them, vast flocks of Orioles. These so pleased
him that he took their colours for his own and they ever
afterward bore his name—a fair exchange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The <span class='it'>Baltimore Oriole</span> comes of a party-coloured American
family—<span class='it'>Icteridæ</span>—that to the eye of the uninitiated at
least would appear to be a hybrid clan drawn from all
quarters of the bird world. Yet it is typically American,
even in this variety; for what other race would have the
temerity to harbour the Bobolink, Orchard and Baltimore
Orioles, Red-wing, Meadowlark, various Grackles, together
with the vagrant Cowbird, in the branches of the
same family tree?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the many welcome facts concerning the Oriole
is the ease with which he is identified; and I say <span class='it'>he</span> advisedly,
for his more industrious half, who is the expert
weaver of the pair, is much the more sombre of hue. In
early May, or even as late as the middle of the month in
backward seasons, you will hear a half-militant, half-complaining
note from the high tree branches. As you
go out to find its origin, it will be repeated, and then a
flash of flame and black will shoot across the range of
vision toward another tree, and the bird, chiding and complaining,
begins a minute search along the smaller twigs
for insects. This is the Oriole, <span class='it'>Icterus galbula</span>, as he
first appears in full spring array,—his head, throat, and
<span class='pageno' title='415' id='Page_415'></span>
top of back and wings black, except a few margins and
quills that are white edged. The breast and underparts,
lower part of back, and lesser wing-coverts are orange
flame, while his tail is partly black and partly orange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two other tree-top birds that arrive at about the
same time, one to remain and one to pass on, wear somewhat
the same combination of red and black,—the Redstart
and the Blackburnian Warbler. But, besides
being much smaller birds, they both belong to the
pretty tribe of Warblers that, with a few notable exceptions,
such as the Chat and Water-thrushes, should
be more properly called ‘lispers’ and not be confused
with the clear-toned Oriole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once the female Oriole arrives, usually several days
after the male, his complaining call, ‘Will you? Will
you really, truly?’ gradually lessens: and after a few
weeks, when nest-building begins, it quite disappears, or
rather, is appropriated by the songless female, who, while
she weaves the nest, is encouraged by the clarion song of
her mate. The plumage of the female is brown and gray
blended with orange above, the head, back, and throat
being mottled with black, while the underparts are
a dull orange, with little of the flaming tints of the
male.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though the Oriole exposes himself more freely to view
than most of our highly coloured birds and in fact seems to
regard his gift of beauty anything but seriously, he takes no
chances, however, in the locating of his nest, which is not
only from twenty feet above the ground upward, but is
suspended from a forked branch that is at once tough yet
so slender that no marauding cat would dare venture to
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span>
it. This pensile nest is diligently woven of grasses, twine,
vegetable fibres, horsehair, bits of worsted, or anything
manageable and varies much in size and shape, as if the
matter of individual taste entered somewhat into the
matter. It has been fairly well proven that location
enters largely into this matter, and that nests in wild
regions, where birds of prey, etc., abound, are smaller
at the top and have a more decided neck than those in
the trees of home lawns and orchard. Of the many nests
that I have found and handled or else observed closely
with a glass, the majority have been quite open at the
top like the one pictured, and the only one with a narrow
and funnel-like opening came from a wayside elm on the
edge of a dense wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The female seems to be weaver-in-chief, using both
claw and bill, though I have seen the male carry her
material. It is asserted that Orioles will weave gayly
coloured worsteds into their nests. This I very much
doubt, or if they do, I believe it is for lack of something
more suitable. I have repeatedly fastened varicoloured
bunches of soft linen twine, carpet-thread, flosses, and the
like under the bark of trees frequented by Orioles, and
with one exception, it has been the more sombre tints that
were selected, though I am told that nests are found made
of very bright colours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the exceptional case a long thread of scarlet linen
floss was taken and woven into the nest for about half its
length, the remainder hanging down; but on resuming
my watch the next day, I found that the weaver had left
the half-finished task and crossed the lawn to another
tree. Whether it was owing to the presence of red squirrels
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span>
close by, or that the red thread had been a subject
for domestic criticism and dissension, we may not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be this as it may, in spite of the bright hues of the parent
birds and the hanging shape of the nest that is never
concealed by a branch upon which it is saddled, like the
home of so many birds, an Oriole’s nest is exceedingly
difficult to locate unless one has noticed the trips to and
fro in the building process; but once the half-dozen white,
darkly etched and spotted eggs it contains hatch out, the
vociferous youngsters at once call attention to the spot
and make their whereabouts known, in spite of sky cradle
and carefully adjusted leaf umbrellas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If their parents bring them food, they squeal (yes, that
is the only word for it); if they are left alone, they do likewise.
Their baby voices can be heard above the wind,
and it is only either at night or during a heavy shower,
when a parent would naturally be supposed to be upon the
nest, that they are silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As an adult, the Oriole lives on rather mixed diet and
has a great love of honey; but of course as a parent he
is, with his sharp beak, a great provider of animal food for
his home, and to his credit must be placed a vast number
of injurious tree-top insects that escape the notice of less
agile birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Complaints are frequently heard of his propensity for
opening pods and eating young peas, piercing the throats
of trumpet-shaped flowers for the honey, and in the
autumn, before the southward migration, siphoning grape
and plum juice by means of this same slender, pointed
bill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Personally, I have never lost peas through his appetite
<span class='pageno' title='418' id='Page_418'></span>
for green vegetables, though I have had the entire floral
output of an old trumpet-vine riddled bud and blossom;
and I have often stood and scolded them from under the
boughs of a Spitzenburgh apple tree, amid the blossoms of
which they were rummaging,—perhaps for insects, but also
scattering the rosy blossoms right and left with torn and
bruised petals. Powell, in <span class='it'>The Independent</span>, writes feelingly
of this trait of the Oriole, thus:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘An Oriole is like a golden shuttle in the foliage of the
trees, but he is the incarnation of mischief. That is just
the word for it. If there is anything possible to be destroyed,
the Oriole likes to tear it up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He wastes a lot of string in building his nest. He is
pulling off apple blossoms now, possibly eating a few
petals. By and by he will pick holes in bushels of grapes,
and in plum season he will let the wasps and hornets into
the heart of every Golden Abundance plum on your
favourite tree.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yet the saucy scamp is so beautiful
that he is tolerated—and he does kill an enormous lot
of insects. There is a swinging nest just over there above
the blackberry bushes. It is wonderfully woven and is a
cradle as well as a house. I should like to have been
brought up in such a homestead.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems as if the Oriole must be a descendant of one
of the brilliant birds that inhabited North America in
by-gone days of tropic heat and that has stayed on
from a matter of hereditary association; for in the
nesting season it is to be found from Florida and
Texas up to New Brunswick and the Saskatchewan
country and westward to the Rockies, beyond which this
type is replaced by Bullock’s Oriole, of much similar
<span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span>
colouring save that it has more orange on the sides of the
head, and the white wing-patch is larger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But however much the Baltimore Oriole loves his
native land, the climate and the exigencies of travel
make his stay in it brief; for he does not appear until
there is some protection of foliage and he starts southward
toward his winter home in Central and South
America often before a single leaf has fallen.</p>

<a id='tan3'></a>“Of all our North American birds, the Tanager is the
most gorgeous and suggestive of the tropics. I do not
understand how any one can fail to name him.
He is unlike any other. Entire body rich
scarlet, wings and tail black; that is all that
there is to remember about him in spring dress. In
autumn he moults to a greenish yellow like his mate,
but still keeps his black wings and tail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This bird is commonly thought to be rare, but that
is because he loves groves of oaks, chestnuts, and beeches,
and Nature has taught him to keep in high deep shade,
that his colour, far richer than the Cardinals, may not
make him a target for enemies, both feathered and
human. But in the migrations he is often to be seen.
Half a dozen were feeding at one time in the garden
and about the lunch-counter this spring, and in May,
whenever I drove about or went to Fair Meadows village,
some one was sure to either ask me the name of the beautiful
red birds that they had seen about the yard, or, if
they knew the bird, tell how plentiful Tanagers had been
this year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Protection has certainly helped this bird, and in some
<span class='pageno' title='421' id='Page_421'></span>
places it is said to be increasing; and as it is distinctly
a bird of high trees, where its nest of loosely built sticks
is placed, it is not so much affected by the modern plague
of cats as either Robin, Song Sparrow, or the Thrushes.
‘The song resembles somewhat that of the Robin, but
is shorter and less varied, with a little apparent hoarseness
or harshness in the tone. Chi-chi-chi-char-ee, char-ee-chi
represents it fairly well.’ It also has a sharp
‘Chip-churr!’ alarm note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Robin, Grosbeak, and Tanager all have certain
notes in common, so that when they all sing at once, it
is often difficult to distinguish the individual songs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tanager is the guardian of the forest trees and
their insect pests. As a caterpillar hunter, it is said
‘he has but few superiors.’ He finds the leaf-rolling
caterpillar in its snug retreat and destroys myriads of
weevils, click-beetles, and crane-flies. The Tanager also
visits orchards, and in early spring, during the migrations,
he braves danger and feeds in the furrows of
ploughed land in the same way as the Grackles and Robins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Tanagers are unique little specimens when they
first leave the nest, for the male birds undergo as many
changes of colour as Harlequin in the pantomime. After
the down of nestlings, they wear the dull colour of the
mother, and before they put on the full spring plumage,
they go through a stage of patchwork such as you see
in this picture in my portfolio. Then after being bright
red all summer, they again go through the patchwork
state before leaving in fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The coming of cold weather evidently warns this
Tanager to go, for being provided with a dull travelling
<span class='pageno' title='422' id='Page_422'></span>
cloak, he need no more fear being seen in the leafless
trees than the Thrushes or Sparrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='gold2'></a><span class='it'>Thistle-bird</span>, <span class='it'>Lettuce-bird</span>, and <span class='it'>Yellowbird</span> are all names
given to this friendly little Sparrow of the stout bill,
black cap, tail, wings, and bright gamboge-yellow
plumage, who lives with us all the
year and is almost always seen in flocks. In spring
we find these birds and their more sober wives feeding
on dandelion seeds. In early summer they glean grass
seeds in the hayfields. In late summer and early autumn
they flutter about the seeding thistle in company with
the rich red butterflies, and after this, the male and female,
garbed alike, then live wherever the wild composite
flowers like asters, sunflowers, or garden marigolds and zinnias
have gone to seed and in the great waste fields of weeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At all times its flight is noticeable for its dip, followed
by an upward jerk, and as they fly, they call ‘per-chic-o-ree-per-chic-o-ree’
(Chapman) in a jolly, gleeful manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In May, June, and July they sing in a varied and
canary-like manner from tree-tops and as they swing on
stalks of grass, having quite powerful voices for their
size, which is under five inches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lover and close observer of these Goldfinches has
written the summer life of a pair of these birds in so
interesting a fashion that I will read it to you. Either
the pair that she describes were very late in nesting, or it
was their second brood.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A GOLDFINCH IDYL</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Do you know of any far-away pasture where, in blueberry
time, Sparrows play hide-and-seek in the bushes,
<span class='pageno' title='423' id='Page_423'></span>
and Finches are like little golden balls tossed on the
breeze? It was in such a field that my Goldfinch found
the thistle-down for her soft couch—<span class='it'>her</span> couch, observe,
for it was the dull mate in greenish olive that made the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was there when the maple twig was chosen for the
nest—as good luck would have it—close by our cottage
door and in plain sight from my window. The choice
was announced by a shower of golden notes from the male
bird and a responsive twitter from his mate. She began
building at once, quickly outlining the nest with grasses
and bark. Her approach was always heralded by a
burst of song from her mate, who hovered near while
she deftly wove the pretty fabric and then flew away
with him to the base of supply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was August 2 when the nest began. I quote from
my note-book:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“August 3. I observed the work closely for an hour.
The working partner made eighteen trips, the first eleven
in twenty-two minutes, grass and thistle-down being
brought; the last nine trips only down, more time being
taken to weave it into the walls. The male warbled
near by and twice flew into the tree and cheered his
industrious mate with song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“August 5. The home growing. The female tarries
much longer at the nest, fashioning the lining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“August 6. Both birds sing while flying to and from
the nest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“August 7. Nest completed. The mother bird has
a little ‘song of the nest’—a very happy song. Think
an egg was laid to-day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“August 11. The male Goldfinch feeds his mate on
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span>
the nest. Flies to her with a jubilant twitter, his mouth
full of seeds. She eagerly takes from twelve to twenty
morsels. They always meet and part with song. Once
the brooding mate grew impatient, flew to the next tree
to meet her provider, took eight or ten morsels, then
flew with him to the nest and took twelve more. A
generous commissary!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“August 17. Breakfast on the nest; twenty-three
morsels from one mouthful. How is it possible for song
to escape from that bill before the unloading? Yet
it never fails.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the record comes to an untimely stop, the reporter
being suddenly called home. But the following
year Nature’s serial opened at the same leaf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toward the last of July, a steady increase in Goldfinch
music, and a subtle change in its meaning marked
the approach of nesting time. Again I quote from my
journal:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“August 8. My careful search was rewarded by the
discovery of a Goldfinch’s nest, barely outlined, in the
rock maple near the former site, but on the road side of
the tree. That my bird friends had returned to the old
treestead I could not doubt, as they bore my scrutiny
with unconcern. In six days the nest was completed.
The builder flew to the brook and drank with her mate,
but rarely stayed away long enough for food supply;
that was carried to her and received on the nest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“August 18. An episode: a rival male flew to the
home tree with the male Goldfinch, both singing delightfully
and circling about the nest. The mate, much
excited, several times flew from the nest and joined in
<span class='pageno' title='425' id='Page_425'></span>
the discussion. Two bouts between the males ended
in the discomfiture of number two and the return of
my Goldfinch with a victor’s song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“August 20. The course of true love now ran smooth,
and Goldfinch, sure of his intrenched affection, sang
less volubly. The female, delicately sensitive of ear,
apparently recognizes the voice of her mate and never
fails to respond. Other Goldfinches flew by in song,
calling and singing, but only one appealed to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“August 25 was a red-letter day in Goldfinch annals;
then, and only then, I saw the male on the nest fed by
his mate. The male then shares incubation? He
certainly gave it a trial, but so far as my observation
goes, found it too confining to be repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“August 29. ‘Out to-day,’ as the newsboy cries—the
female’s elevation on the nest determined that.
Her eagerness now overcame caution, and she flew
straight to the nest instead of in a roundabout course.
Both parents fed the young.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“August 30. In a single trip the male Goldfinch
brought forty morsels to the family, his mate eager to
get her ‘thirds,’ but as soon as he had gone she slipped
off the nest and fed the young. This method was pursued
for three days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sept. 1. The female very active at the nest, making
toilets of young, reassuring them with tender syllables
when a red squirrel ran up the tree with alarming sounds.
I saw three open mouths. The brooding bird went
for food and returned stealthily to the nest. The male
came once, but brought nothing, and henceforth was
an idle partner.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span>
“Sept. 6. Young birds, having found their voices,
announced meal time with joyous twitter. They were
fed, on an average, once in forty-five minutes and were
now forming cleanly habits, like young Swallows, voiding
excrement over the rim of the nest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sept. 8. The old bird no longer perching at the
nest to feed her young, but on the branch, to lure them
from their cradle. They shook their wings vigorously
and preened their tiny feathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sept. 11. Young Finches ventured to the edge of
the nest and peered curiously into the unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sept. 11. An empty nest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<a id='gros2'></a>In spite of the rosy wing-linings and shield set above
his white breast, the Rose-breasted Grosbeak is the
least conspicuous of the Singers in Costume.
The reason for this is, that unless you are either
directly under or before him, the richly coloured
breast may escape notice and only the dark back appear.
Yet to one who knows birds, even the back will serve
to name him, for no other familiar songster has so much
black and white about him—black head and back, a
white rump, black-and-white wings, and black-and-white
tail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Grosbeak delights in young woodlands where
the trees are small and well branched, and the big, rather
loosely woven nest of weeds, twigs, and various wood
fibres is seldom placed as high as even the Robin’s or
Tanager’s, and yet, in spite of the fact that female birds
<span class='pageno' title='427' id='Page_427'></span>
are supposed to have dull feathers because they will
be less seen when on the nest, I have seen a gorgeous
male brooding the eggs in bright daylight, the nest
being on a low sapling in a rather thickly wooded brush-lot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Rose-breast is very useful as a killer of large beetles
and insects, and from his prowess with the striped potato-beetle
has been called locally the ‘Potato Bird’; but it
is for its song that we love and prize him as one of the
birds that to miss from the garden, means that one of
the best features of the season has been lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to what Audubon said of this song, that great
pioneer naturalist, whose pure nature and spiritual
kinship with the birds never forsook him in hours of
adversity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘One year, in the month of August, I was trudging
along the shores of the Mohawk River, when night overtook
me. Being little acquainted with that part of the
country, I resolved to camp where I was. The evening
was calm and beautiful, the sky sparkled with stars,
which were reflected by the smooth waters, and the
deep shade of the rocks and trees of the opposite shore
fell on the bosom of the stream, while gently from afar
came on the ear the muttering sound of the cataract.
My little fire was soon lighted under a rock, and, spreading
out my scanty stock of provisions, I reclined on my
grassy couch. As I looked around on the fading features
of the beautiful landscape, my heart turned toward my
distant home, where my friends were doubtless wishing
me, as I wished them, a happy night and peaceful slumbers.
Then were heard the barkings of the watch-dog
<span class='pageno' title='428' id='Page_428'></span>
and I tapped my faithful companion to prevent his answering
them. The thoughts of my worldly mission
then came over my mind, and having thanked the Creator
of all for His never-failing mercy, I closed my eyes and
was passing away into the world of dreaming existence,
when suddenly there burst on my soul the serenade of
the Rose-breasted Bird, so rich, so mellow, so loud in
the stillness of the night, that sleep fled from my eyelids.
Never did I enjoy music more: it thrilled through my
heart and surrounded me with an atmosphere of bliss.
One might easily have imagined that even the Owl,
charmed by such delightful music, remained reverently
silent. Long after the sounds ceased did I enjoy them,
and when all had again become still, I stretched out my
wearied limbs and gave myself up to the luxury of repose.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a near-by garden neighbour, the Rose-breast, though
shy by nature, may become as intimate as the Wood
Thrush, and if you are near his feeding-haunts you will
notice, aside from his song, he has a way of talking when
he feeds and that, with a little imagination, you can
translate his words to suit yourself. I had once thought
this an idea of my own, but this clipping in my scrap-book
proves the contrary, and that others have made
his notes into words.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>A TALKING ROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Early last summer, while standing on my back steps,
I heard a cheerful voice say, “You’re a pretty bird.
Where are you?” I supposed it to be the voice of a
Parrot, but wondered how any Parrot could talk loud
<span class='pageno' title='429' id='Page_429'></span>
enough to be heard at that distance, for the houses on
the street back of us are quite a way off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost before I had done laughing, the voice came
again, clear, musical, and strong—“You’re a pretty
bird. Where are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several days I endured the suspense of waiting
for time to investigate. Then I chased him up. There
he was in the top of a walnut tree, his gorgeous attire telling
me immediately that he was a Rose-breasted Grosbeak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of a week he varied his compliment to,
“Pretty, pretty bird, where are you? Where are you?”
with a kind of impatient jerk on the last “you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and his mate stayed near us all last summer, and
though I heard him talk a hundred times, yet he always
brought a feeling of gladness and a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our friend has come back again this spring. About
May 1st I heard the same endearing compliment as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several of my friends whom I have told about him
have asked, “Does he say the words plainly? Do you
mean that he really talks?” My reply is, “He says
them just as plainly as a bird ever says anything, so
plainly, that even now I laugh whenever I hear him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is not very easily frightened, and sometimes talks
quite a while when I am standing under the tree where
he is.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='431' id='Page_431'></span><h1>XXVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>FLAG DAY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The Spring Sale of the work of the Kind Hearts’ Club
was held the Saturday after Arbour and Bird Day.
People who had seen the bird-houses that their friends
had bought at Christmas drove over from towns many
miles away, while those who had been before came again
and seemed perfectly fascinated by the birds’ baths and
drinking-troughs made from the hollowed logs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The money thus being secure, the wayside drinking-fountain
for man, beast, and bird was begun at once
and before Memorial Day was completed and the water
turned on, to Tommy’s great pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor were the children obliged to spend all their pennies
upon the work, for besides the actual money, they had
earned something of more value—the confidence and co-operation
of their own parents and of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the work that Gray Lady had begun at Foxes
Corners school was thought to be merely a passing fancy
or a matter of sentiment only, but day by day many of
those who were not only indifferent, but perhaps aggressive,
saw that common sense went hand in hand
with the common humanity that the Kind Hearts’ Club
expressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flag Day, that year falling upon a Friday, was to be
the last regular bird lesson for the Foxes Corners school.
Now that the planting season had come, and the summer
<span class='pageno' title='432' id='Page_432'></span>
vacation was near, the Friday afternoons were needed
for making up back work on the part of those who had
been absent and in preparing for examinations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In some way it seemed to be an understood fact that
Rose Wilde would go to Bridgeton to teach in the High
School, and it was a subject about which her pupils were
very unhappy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were to be some patriotic exercises at the school
in the morning as usual; then Miss Wilde asked Gray
Lady, who had been away for several days, if the children
might not have their afternoon talk at Swallow Chimney
instead of at the school, as the air in the low room was
quite heavy and uncomfortable in the warm June afternoons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luncheon was hardly over on that day before Goldilocks
began to show unusual signs of hurry. In answer
to her mother’s question as to what made her so restless,
she replied, “I’m so afraid we may be late. I promised
Miss Wilde we would be over by half-past one,”
and then stopped and looked confused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not see how we can be late when the class cannot
begin by itself,” said Gray Lady, smiling, for she was
well aware that there was something unusual in the air,
but exactly what, she had purposely kept herself from
guessing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, she did not aggravate Goldilocks by any
unnecessary delay, and half-past one saw mother and
daughter going through the garden toward the gate of
Birdland. Goldilocks, for some mysterious reason, kept
her eyes upon the ground, while it seemed to her as if
her mother stopped an endlessly long time to admire
<span class='pageno' title='433' id='Page_433'></span>
every shrub and to gather a bunch of delicately pencilled
pansies of lilac, mauve, and royal purple to fasten in the
belt of her soft gray muslin gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the pair came out from the shadow of the overhanging
vines of the garden walk, a low murmur and
the distinct words “here she comes” made Gray Lady
pause and look toward the rustic gate of Birdland. As
she did so, the gate opened, and inside she saw the school
children drawn up in line on either side of the grass path
that formed a natural aisle to the middle of the orchard,
where several of the old trees had crumbled away, leaving
an open space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must walk right on,” whispered Goldilocks,
clutching her mother’s hand and almost pulling her
along. So, wishing every one good day right and left
as she went, Gray Lady allowed herself to be led, the
children closing in and following.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the bright light in the open space blinded
Gray Lady, and then she saw that a tall flagpole was
planted in the centre of the open,—a slender pole,
flawless from bottom to top, polished and smooth as
glass. On the top was perched a gilded eagle with wings
wide-spread; in the halyards on the pole a loosely
folded bundle was caught, and the end of the line was
in the hands of Jack Todd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gray Lady stood quite still looking from one to the
other, her breath coming fast. Then Jack jerked the
line, and out of the bundle, fold on fold, fell a large flag;
slowly it rose to the top of the pole and floated in the
breeze, while at the little click of Miss Wilde’s tuning-fork
twenty-five fresh young voices broke into song.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='435' id='Page_435'></span>
The singing ceased, and Gray Lady stood with bent
head, a smile upon her lips and tears in her eyes, for
often when one is happiest, the two go together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words of the hymn had been written by a dear
friend on one of the anniversaries of the day that the
General gave his life for his flag’s honour, and forgetting
that Goldilocks knew, Gray Lady had thought that
no one remembered the verses but herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommy and Sarah, to whom it had fallen to explain
the occasion in a little speech of Miss Wilde’s wording,
stepped forward, then looked at each other and seemed
struck dumb. Sarah found her tongue first and also
her own wording for the speech; clasping her hands
nervously, she began: “Last fall when we had the orchard
party, you said ‘some day Birdland must have a flagpole
of its own,’ so we thought we would all do it and
Miss Wilde said, ‘yes.’ The big boys cut the pole in
Haines’ woods (he let them), and they shaped it out and
polished it all themselves, and Jacob helped set it yesterday.
We were awfully afraid you wouldn’t go to New
York so’s they could do it without being seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='436' id='Page_436'></span>
“Miss Wilde fitted the music to the words, and Mrs.
Wilde cut out the flag, and the rest of us all sewed on
it, the little boys too. The stripes were easy, but some
of the stars wiggled in the points, because it’s hard turning
sharp corners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all bought the eagle, not in a store,—they cost
too much,—but of the junk pedler, and it’s been done
over. It’s a good strong one, better than they make
nowadays, grandma says.” Then, as Sarah realized
that she had forgotten all the expressions of thanks
for the happiness that had come to them at “the General’s”
which Miss Wilde had so carefully worded and
drilled them to pronounce correctly, she gave a despairing
look at their friend and, seeing something in her face
that invited her, cast herself into Gray Lady’s arms.</p>

<hr class='tbk135'/>

<p class='pindent'>After the flag had been lowered, duly examined, and
praised, and the crooked stars declared to be quite natural,
because, as Goldilocks truthfully remarked, “real stars
twinkle and always look crooked, you know,” Gray
Lady said: “Now that I know the beautiful surprise
you had for me, I will tell you a little secret of my own.
It is true, as rumour says, that Miss Wilde is going to leave
Foxes Corners school at the term end, but <span class='it'>not</span> to go to
Bridgeton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is going to have a little school all of her own in
the big room at Swallow Chimney, with Goldilocks and
as many of you for pupils as wish to go to the High
School by and by and are ready for the eighth grade.
Yes, I have arranged it with the school committee, and
<span class='pageno' title='437' id='Page_437'></span>
it is perfectly satisfactory to them. Oh! children, do
not smother me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Tommy Todd suddenly realized that he had
not only thought of following Sarah’s example and
hugging Gray Lady, but that he had actually done so!</p>

the wit and wisdom and graceful phrase within its covers. The Commuter’s
charming woman writes of her suburban garden, her original servants, and
various other incidents which come in the course of living in a thoroughly
human way. She reminds one of Elizabeth of ‘German Garden’ fame in more
ways than one, but being American she is broader, more versatile and humorous,
if not also more poetic. It breathes an air of cheery companionship, of
flowers, birds, all nature, and the warm affection of human friendship. Its
philosophy is wholesome, unselfish, and kindly, and the Commuter’s Wife, who
writes her own memoirs, is one we would be glad to number among our
friends.”—<span class='it'>The Evening Post</span>, Chicago.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
